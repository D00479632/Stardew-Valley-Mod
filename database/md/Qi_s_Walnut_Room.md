Qi's Walnut Room

Open Hours: Always Address: Ginger Island Occupants:

Mr. Qi

The **Walnut Room** is located on the West side of Ginger Island. It can be opened once the player obtains a total of 100 golden walnuts. Inside is a Perfection Tracker, a Special Order Board, and a Vending Machine that sells items in exchange for Qi Gems.

Qi Gems can't be earned before unlocking the room, as the 3 methods to obtain them (via the Special Orders Board, by activating the Shrine of Challenge, and by exchanging Golden Walnuts) require entering this room.

## Perfection Tracker

The perfection tracker is a statistics board that shows the player how much of the game they have completed.

The perfection score shown in the room is always rounded down (*e.x.* if the player has completed 80.6% of perfection, the percentage shown on the perfection tracker will be 80%). This also means that the perfection score will only show 100% if the player has actually achieved 100% Perfection. Reaching 100% Perfection unlocks new content.

This includes Kent, so it is not possible to complete this in year 1. ***Note:** The "maximum hearts" for datable villagers is 8, and for non-datable villagers, 10 is the max. If the player has children, their friendship status does not affect the score.* 34 11% Farmer Level Reach level 10 in every skill. 25 5% Found All Stardrops Find all Stardrops. 7 10% Cooking Recipes Made Cook every recipe. 81 10% Crafting Recipes Made Craft all items.

## Special Orders Board

*Main article: Quests*

The board refreshes with two new quests to choose from every Monday.

Quest Name Quest Text Maximum Timeframe Requirements Rewards Qi's Crop I've hidden Qi Beans throughout the world. Find them, grow them, propagate them, and ship 500 Qi Fruit within the time limit. 28 days Ship Qi Fruit (500).

*Ship using the Shipping Bin for credit. Selling to Pierre does not count.*

data-sort-value="100"&gt; 100 Let's Play A Game Think you can score 50,000 points in Junimo Kart endless mode? Prove it. 7 days Score 50,000 points in Junimo Kart endless mode. data-sort-value="20"&gt; 20 Four Precious Stones Find 4 prismatic shards. Place them in my collection box. 28 days Collect Prismatic Shard (4).

*Items must be collected while quest is active.*

data-sort-value="40"&gt; 40 Qi's Hungry Challenge Your task is to make it to level 100 in the Skull Cavern. However, you can't eat or drink anything while there. 7 days Reach floor 100 of the Skull Cavern without consuming any food or drink items. This can be done using Staircases.

While this quest is active, Big Slimes will occasionally spawn with a heart in them that will recover 10 HP when dropped. This doubles to 20 HP if the player has the Burglar's Ring. Another way to regain health during the quest is to use equipment with passive healing bonuses, such as the Vampire Ring, the Fairy Box, or a weapon with the Vampiric enchantment.

Buffs from food or drinks consumed before entering the cavern stay active for their normal duration.

data-sort-value="25"&gt; 25 Qi's Cuisine Ship 100,000g worth of freshly cooked items. 14 days Ship data-sort-value="100000"&gt;100,000g worth of freshly cooked items. Only items cooked after accepting the special order count, and these items have the word "Fresh" in front of their name.

Two easy ways of completing this special order are:

1. Buy or brew 669 Coffee (costing data-sort-value="200700"&gt;200,700g, if purchased from The Stardrop Saloon) and cook 223 Fresh Triple Shot Espresso.
2. Grow 1667 Wheat, turn them into Wheat Flour (or purchase 1667 wheat flour, costing data-sort-value="166700"&gt;166,700g if bought from Pierre's General Store, or data-sort-value="208375"&gt;208,375g if bought from JojaMart), then cook 1667 Fresh Bread.

data-sort-value="25"&gt; 25 Qi's Kindness Give 50 loved gifts in one week. 7 days Give 50 loved gifts in one week. One gift can be given to each villager per day (a total of two gifts per week, per villager), and there are a total of 34 giftable villagers. Therefore, this quest can be completed in at least two days by gifting all 34 villagers on the first day, then 16 villagers the next day for a total of 50 gifts.

*Stardrop Tea does not count for this quest.*

**Tips** 

- If done long before this quest, building a Deluxe Coop filled with rabbits for their universally loved Rabbit's Foot is a great way to gift every giftable villager in town (with the exception of Penny). Other universally loved gifts can also be used, but are much harder to get in massive quantities.
- Crystalariums can be used to make Diamonds, which are loved by 8 villagers. As for the other gems, all of them are loved by at least 3 villagers. The Prismatic Shard is a special case in that it is universally loved (apart from by Haley) but it cannot be replicated in a Crystalarium.
- Other items which are loved by at least 3 villagers and are also relatively easy to stockpile are Cactus Fruit, Chocolate Cake, Iridium Bar, Pink Cake and Pumpkin.
- Penny's hate of Rabbit's Foot can be bypassed with easy-to-obtain loved gifts such as Diamond, Emerald, Poppy, Melon, Sandfish, and Books.

data-sort-value="40"&gt; 40 Extended Family Family members of the legendary fish have returned to the valley. You have three days to catch Ms. Angler, Glacierfish Jr., Son of Crimsonfish, Radioactive Carp, and Legend II. 3 days Catch Ms. Angler, Glacierfish Jr., Son of Crimsonfish, Radioactive Carp, and Legend II. They can be caught in the same locations as the older generation of fish but the fishing bar is not distinctly marked as it is with the original legendary fish. It does not have to be raining for Legend II to appear, as the original Legend.

The same level requirements for the original legendary fish apply for these fish as well. This means that it is impossible to complete this quest without either reaching fishing level 10 or getting there temporarily via Buffs, as that is the level requirement necessary to hook a Legend II, as with the original Legend.

data-sort-value="20"&gt; 20 Danger In The Deep The mine elevator system has been reset, and new dangers have emerged from deep underground. Make it to the bottom of the mines in one week. 7 days Reach the bottom of the Mines in the Mountains. This can be done using Staircases.

*This quest will also reset unlocked purchasable gear from the Adventurer's Guild.*

data-sort-value="50"&gt; 50 Skull Cavern Invasion The Skull Cavern has been invaded by powerful monsters. Make it to level 100 in one piece. 7 days Make it to floor 100 of the Skull Cavern. This can be done using Staircases. data-sort-value="40"&gt; 40 Qi's Prismatic Grange Find 100 each of red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and purple items. Place them in my collection box. 14 days Place 100 x red, 100 x orange, 100 x yellow, 100 x green, 100 x blue, and 100 x purple items into Qi's collection box.

*This quest is more strict than dye pots are. For a list of eligible items, see the bold items on the dye pots page. Different items can be used for the same color. The items do not need to be collected while the quest is active. Deposited items will not be returned.*

**Tips** 

The following items are easy to obtain if the player has extra money:

- **Red**: Spaghetti from the Stardrop Saloon (Cost: data-sort-value="240"&gt;240g x 100 = data-sort-value="24000"&gt;24,000g)
- **Orange**: Copper Ore from the Blacksmith (Cost: data-sort-value="150"&gt;150g x 100 = data-sort-value="15000"&gt;15,000g)
- **Yellow**: Hay from Marnie's Ranch (Cost: data-sort-value="50"&gt;50g x 100 = data-sort-value="5000"&gt;5,000g)
- **Green**: Salad from the Stardrop Saloon (Cost: data-sort-value="220"&gt;220g x 100 = data-sort-value="22000"&gt;22,000g)
- **Blue**: Joja Cola from the vending machine in the Stardrop Saloon or at JojaMart (Cost: data-sort-value="75"&gt;75g x 100 = data-sort-value="7500"&gt;7,500g)
- **Purple**: Void Essence bought from Krobus, limit 10 essence per day (Cost: data-sort-value="100"&gt;100g x 100 = data-sort-value="10000"&gt;10,000g)
