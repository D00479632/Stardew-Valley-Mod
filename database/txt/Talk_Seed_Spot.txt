Mixed Seeds
Has v1.6 behavior changed so that Mixed Seeds will no longer be found at artifact spots, but rather at seed spots? Giles (talk) 19:47, 21 March 2024 (UTC)
Season Template Change
I know it was discussed before but I've already changed it in other languages too as you wanted, so what was the reason? (I didn't do for Japanese because it's different and Chinese was reverted by an editor for the same reason) I can revert back the changes in other languages if needed.

Ideally the template would display the most shorthand version of season + date, so icon then date then name of season. The template should handle the display, so the day should be a parameter inside the template rather than text after the template. margotbean (talk) 22:40, 26 October 2024 (UTC)
