The **Sea Urchin** is a forageable item found year-round in the Tide Pool section of the Beach, *i.e.,* to the east of the wooden footbridge\[1].

During Summer 12-14 extra Sea Urchins appear anywhere on the beach (including possibly the western section). It may also be found foraging on levels 1-29 of the Mines while the Shrine of Challenge is enabled, or the Danger in The Deep quest is active.

The average spawn rate for Sea Urchin in the tide pool section of the beach is 0.23/day. An additional 0.8 (on average) Sea Urchins per day will spawn during Summer 12-14. These spawn rates are not affected by the presence of other forageable items on the beach; in particular, Sea Urchins are not part of the standard six item per map limit on forageable items. 7 Foraging XP are granted for every Sea Urchin picked up, and all Foraging bonuses apply to Sea Urchins.

Emily may occasionally send you a Sea Urchin in the mail as a gift. She also sells five Sea Urchins at her shop at the Desert Festival for data-sort-value="5"&gt; 5 Calico Eggs each. All saltwater Crab Pot fish may also produce a Sea Urchin in a Fish Pond, when the population of the pond reaches 5. It can also be gifted by a pet turtle with max friendship.

Although Sea Urchins are not otherwise considered to be fish, they can be placed in a Fish Pond, where they will reproduce every 4 days. The initial pond capacity is 10 Sea Urchins; no quests are necessary to increase the pond capacity. The only possible output is purple Sea Urchin Roe.
