The Old Mariner appears on the beach past the bridge that costs 300 wood to repair. He will appear between 6am â€“ 7pm, and only on rainy days. He can appear in Winter if a Rain Totem is used, but does not appear during the Night Market, even if it is raining.
The following conditions must be met to purchase it:

If the player is already married or has a housemate, the Old Mariner will appear but will not sell a Mermaid's Pendant. If the player gets divorced, they can purchase another one, which can be given to any marriage candidate. If the player is engaged but not yet married, they can return to the Old Mariner and purchase another pendant.
The Mermaid's Pendant cannot be sold.
Trivia
