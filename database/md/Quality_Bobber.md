Quality Bobber Boosts the quality of fish that you catch. Information Source Crafting Sell Price data-sort-value="300"&gt;300g Crafting Recipe Source "Juicy Bugs Wanted!" Special Order Ingredients Copper Bar (1) Sap (20) Solar Essence (5)

The **Quality Bobber** is a tackle that increases the quality of fish caught by one level (*e.g.,* silver → gold). It can be crafted from a recipe received from Willy in the cutscene that follows the completion of the "Juicy Bugs Wanted!" Special Order. One Quality Bobber is received after solving the puzzle in Journal Scrap #4 on Ginger Island.

Using two Quality Bobbers on an Advanced Iridium Rod increases the quality of fish caught by two levels.

Aside from getting perfect catches, using this tackle is the only way to catch iridium quality fish. It is one of two fishing tackle that cannot be bought from Willy's Fish Shop, along with the Curiosity Lure.

Only the Iridium Rod or the Advanced Iridium Rod can equip tackle. The Iridium Rod can only attach one tackle at a time, while the Advanced Iridium Rod can attach two. To attach tackle, left-click on the tackle, then right-click on the rod. To remove tackle, first right-click to remove any bait, then right-click to remove the tackle. For an Advanced Iridium Rod, the left tackle will be the first one removed.

Tackle does not stack in inventory or chests; each tackle takes up one inventory slot.
