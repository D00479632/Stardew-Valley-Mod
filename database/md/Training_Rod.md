Training Rod It's a lot easier to use than other rods, but can only catch basic fish. Information Previous Tier: N/A Next Tier: Bamboo Pole Cost: data-sort-value="25"&gt;25g

Sold by: Fish Shop

The **Training Rod** is a special tool used to catch fish. It can be purchased for data-sort-value="25"&gt;25g from Willy's Fish Shop.

Alternatively, on or after Spring 28 Year 1, if the player has been given the Bamboo Pole but has not reached Fishing level 1, entering the farm before 11:30 am on a sunny day will cause Willy to visit and give the player a Training Rod and a fishing lesson which gives them Fishing level 1.

This rod is useful if the player has difficulty with the fishing minigame, as it sets the player's fishing skill equal to level 5 for the purposes of determining how big to make the green bar (136 pixels) if they have not reached level 5 yet. It cannot have bait or tackle attached to it. However, using the Training Rod causes the progress bar to decrease 33% slower compared to other rods, having the same effect as the Trap Bobber.\[1]

The Training Rod can catch only basic fish (fish whose difficulty is lower than 50), and all fish caught will be of normal quality. However, fish caught with the Training Rod grant the same XP as with any other fishing rod, and count towards Achievements and the Fish Collection. Treasure chests can also be caught with this rod. The Spawn rate for all eligible fish also increases by 10%.\[2]
