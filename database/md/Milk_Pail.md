Milk Pail Gather milk from your animals. Information Cost: data-sort-value="1000"&gt;1,000g

Sold by: Marnie's Ranch

The **Milk Pail** is a tool used to gather milk from cows and goats. It must be purchased from Marnie's Ranch for data-sort-value="1000"&gt;1,000g.

Each use of the Milk Pail to milk a cow or goat consumes 4 points of energy, and increases the player's Farming experience by 5 points.

Using the Milk Pail on an animal other than a cow or goat will produce the message "\[Animal name] doesn't produce milk."

Once the player has reached Farming Level 10, an Auto-Grabber can be purchased from Marnie's Ranch for data-sort-value="25000"&gt;25,000g, which will automatically milk all cows and goats from the barn in which it is placed.
