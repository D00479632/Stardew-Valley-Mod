**Magic Bait** is a type of bait that provides the ability to catch any fish from that source regardless of weather, time, or season. Magic Bait has the same effect on fish bite rate as standard Bait (decreasing biting time by 50%).\[1]

Magic Bait cannot be used with the Training Rod or the Bamboo Pole. Only the Fiberglass Rod, the Iridium Rod, and the Advanced Iridium Rod can use bait. It can also technically be inserted into a Crab Pot, but it is no better than standard bait as all crab pot fish can be caught regardless of weather or season.
