Correction needed on farm page
Sorry this is my first time ever "contributing" on a wiki, in the end I just wanted to report an error:
On the [Forest map](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Farm_Maps#Forest) it is written the following:
> The number of tillable tiles on this map is 1413, with 1490 non-tillable but build-able tiles.
I think there is a need for a recount.

Issue with images
When I try to bring up the image for the Hilltop Farm or the Beach Farm, I only see part of the image. The thumbnail is fine, it's only when I click through that I have a problem. And the images for the other farm types are fine. Anybody else seeing this? Zendowolf (talk) 00:46, 5 July 2022 (UTC)
Yes, I've told the server people about it. Still waiting for some action, I'm afraid. margotbean (talk) 14:58, 5 July 2022 (UTC)
Any new info or action? Some of the images are still broken in that regard, and they don't load properly in the viewer. Seem to be corruped. Blushock (talk) 06:07, 17 January 2023 (UTC)
Yes, I pester the server people regularly about it. They've applied some fixes, but finding the root cause seems to be elusive. margotbean (talk) 07:48, 17 January 2023 (UTC)
Unused images
For whatever reason, when I click on the files Standard Farm, Riverland Farm, Forest Farm, Hill-top Farm, or Wilderness Farm, it does not say that any pages use this file when they actually are in a page. 9000 (talk) 8:40, 14 July 2022 (UTC)
update in 1.6.9
Sorry I’m non-native in English, so l can’t determine what this sentence exactly means;
In version history on 1.6.9
Fixed forest fish no longer catchable on the four corners farm
Which this means, “now we can catch forest fish correctly in 4 corners farm” or “now we become not be able to catch forest fish in 4 corners farm”? Mmtraa7 (talk) 13:46, 15 November 2024 (UTC)
It means "now we can catch forest fish correctly on the 4-corners farm" margotbean (talk) 14:33, 15 November 2024 (UTC)
Thank you very much! Mmtraa7 (talk) 17:43, 15 November 2024 (UTC)
Tillable and buildable tiles
Hello, obligatory apologies for being a first time wiki-editor, but I have taken it upon myself to recalculate the number of tillable tiles as well as non-tillable-but-buildable tiles for all of the maps, seeing as the numerical information provided on the wiki is mostly unsubstantiated. I have come to two conclusions in this regard:
94 buildable tiles on every map are always going to be occupied by the starter buildings which cannot be removed, but can be moved around freely
A farm's total tilled soil can easily be displayed, thus calculated, using the Farm Computer
Could this be relevant information to add under a potential "Notes" heading? SwagChild (talk) 14:27, 10 January 2025 (UTC)
