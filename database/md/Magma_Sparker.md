**Magma Sparker** are an enemy found in the Volcano Dungeon. 150 Magma monsters (either type) need to be killed for the Monster Eradication Goal at the Adventurer's Guild.

## Behavior

Magma Sparker will fly through walls towards the player at high velocities, dealing damage and causing the Burnt debuff on hit. Like Slimes, it can "charge" the player, making a quick dash. The player can dodge the charge by moving or alternatively blocking them with the sword's special ability.

They are common, meaning that they can easily swarm the player with their counterparts Magma Sprites if they are not equipped with a strong enough weapon.
