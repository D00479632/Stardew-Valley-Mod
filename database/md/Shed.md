## Behavior

Sheds act like small farmhouses, allowing players a room inside to decorate however they'd like with furniture, wallpaper, and flooring. The exterior is 7x3, smaller than its unupgraded 11x9 interior. The interior of the upgraded Big Shed is 17x12. This allows the player to effectively redistribute space on the farm.

## Interior

The initial interior of the shed is bare. The interior dimensions of the shed are 11x9, which is approximately the same size as the player's starting farmhouse. The Big Shed has dimensions of 17x12, providing slightly more than twice the area of the starting shed.
