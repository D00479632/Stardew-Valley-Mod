## Vandalism

Your repeated efforts to create pages and discussion surrounding the soggy newspaper constitutes vandalism. Please refrain from such edits in the future, as it will result in temporary or permanent banning. Thank you, margotbean (talk) 08:49, 20 September 2022 (UTC)

out of curiosity how is it vandalism? (the answer probably right in front of my face) soggy newspaper for some strange reason even I don't know is my favorite item in the game i wasn't trying to vandalize anything. also thanks for rules box. ShadowFireFarm (talk) 10:59, 20 September 2022 (UTC)

I appreciate that you weren't trying to vandalize, which is why you are not currently banned. Reading through Help:Editing, especially the section "Content protocols" would probably be helpful to you. You are free to declare your love for the Soggy Newspaper on your talk page, but the main area of the wiki should be an objective encyclopedia of the game.

If you're looking for social interaction, discord, reddit, and the forums (links in the left sidebar) would be more appropriate places than the wiki. Happy Farming! margotbean (talk) 16:29, 20 September 2022 (UTC)
