## Menu

Gus offers a variety of food and recipes for sale. He also has a rotating supply of cooked dishes.

To shop at the Saloon, interact with the cash register on the counter. It is possible to shop at the register as long as Gus is anywhere behind the counter. When Gus visits Ginger Island, he leaves a cash box on the bar, so the player is still able to make purchases.

Note: The Cookie recipe will be available only for players who have seen Evelyn's 4-heart event but experienced a bug where they have not received the Cookie recipe.
