“ “I was born an ordinary boy, but I made a decision early in life that I would become extraordinary.” — Mr. Qi

**Mr. Qi** is a mysterious stranger who is first encountered when the player puts a Battery Pack into the lock-box in the tunnel. He is connected to the empty box at the train station.

He operates the Casino which is located behind Sandy's store, the Oasis, in the Calico Desert. To gain access to the Casino players must complete the quest line "The Mysterious Qi". After the quest is complete the Bouncer will move aside to allow the player to enter. He can be found inside the Casino whenever it is open.

He also can be found on Ginger Island in his walnut room, once the player has obtained 100 Golden Walnuts. Here, he will give the player special Qi challenges. Upon completing these challenges, the player will be rewarded with Qi Gems.

## Gifts

Players cannot give gifts to raise friendship points with Mr. Qi.

## Schedule

Mr. Qi can always be found both at the Casino during the Oasis' open hours and in Qi's Walnut Room on Ginger Island.

“ “It's good to finally meet ya, kid. Welcome to my exclusive clubhouse. You've got the 'spark'... that's why I singled you out. What spark? Ah... The conduit of mystery, of art... People like us have a responsiblity \[sic] to keep the world alive, to give folks a taste of the extraordinary. You see, kid... The world's like a bowl of rice. It's got substance, but it ain't worth nothin' without a good, zesty sauce. That's where we come in. Didn't you ever wonder who put those treasure chests in the old mineshaft? I like to give people surprises. You'll understand someday. Just keep doing your best and never give up.”

“ “I was born an ordinary boy, but I made a decision early in life that I would become extraordinary.”

“ “Hey. Don't tell anyone about this place, okay? I want to keep it... exclusive. You'd keep a secret for your friend Mr. Qi, wouldn't you?”

“ “Never stop striving to achieve perfection. Settle for nothing less than excellence in everything you do.”

“ “Stop by whenever you wanna relax.”

“ “Keep working hard and maybe you'll end up like me someday.”

**Qi's Walnut Room**  

**First time entering the Walnut Room**

“ “Well, well, well... Look who's made it to my secret walnut room. I'm truly impressed. Even though you only needed a fraction of the walnuts to gain full access to the island, you decided to push yourself further. Your desire to enter this secret door was so strong, that you went above and beyond to get inside. That drive is what sets you apart, kid. You've got a very special energy. That being said... You weren't under the impression that the challenge ended here, were you? No... Hah. Hah. Hah... In fact, the challenge has just begun. On your left, you'll find a board with some very interesting opportunities. These challenges, which I've designed just for you, will push you to your very limit. However, if you can successfully conquer my challenges, you'll earn an exclusive currency... I call them 'Qi Gems'. Just don't put 'em in your mouth, kid... They're highly radioactive. Heh. heh. heh... You can use the machine on your right to trade these Qi Gems for rare and powerful rewards. Sounds interesting, doesn't it? Yes... I have a feeling someone like you will enjoy this, very much... Now, if you'll excuse me... I have important business to attend to.”

“ “I'm impressed with your tenacity, kid... it took a lot of walnuts to get this far.”

“ “Wherever you go... I'm always behind the curtain, making sure the show is interesting. Hahaha... Or... am I?”

“ “Set your eyes on the furthest star, and let that be your goal. It's always within your power to go one step further than you used to believe.”

“ “Some things transcend time and space, kid. It's a unique feeling in the heart... a whisper of things beyond.”
