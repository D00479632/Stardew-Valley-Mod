Topaz Ring can be used in dyeing, serving as an orange dye at the dye pots, located in Emily's and Haley's house, 2 Willow Lane.

## Trivia

- Before 1.6, this item used to increase weapon precision (decreases the chance that a strike will cause no damage) by 10% while equipped. This effect is useless because weapons do not have a random chance to miss under normal conditions.
