Behavior
Spiders will jump next to the player, and deal damage on hit. They are immune to damage while jumping. They tend to spawn in large swarms, and can easily overwhelm a player who is not equipped with a strong enough weapon.
Strategy
Their immunity to knockback makes them an ideal target for a hammer's special attack, which can kill many of them in an instant. It is almost impossible to fight large numbers of them without taking damage, so an alternate strategy is to simply swing a Vampiric sword repeatedly and try to out-heal any damage taken. Alternatively, a weapon enchanted with Bug Killer can help deal greater damage. While fighting Spiders, beware of nearby Putrid Ghosts.
