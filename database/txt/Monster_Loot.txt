Monster Loot is dropped from slain Monsters in The Mines and Skull Cavern. It can be sold at the Adventurer's Guild or by depositing it in the Shipping bins. Monster Loot may also be gifted (as an universal disliked or hated gift) or used for Crafting.
Monsters may drop many other items when slain, but the following items are classified as "Monster Loot" in-game.
