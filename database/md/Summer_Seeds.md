**Summer Seeds** are a type of Crafted seed. The crafting recipe is labeled "Wild Seeds (Su)", but when crafted, the result is "Summer Seeds." Mature plants yield, at random, a Grape, Spice Berry, or Sweet Pea.

Summer Seeds are one of the season-specific crafted wild seeds, along with Spring Seeds, Fall Seeds, and Winter Seeds that produce crops normally found as forage. While Farming Skill normally increases the chance to grow a quality crop, Foraging Skill increases the chance to grow a quality crop from Summer Seeds. Choosing the Botanist profession will ensure iridium-quality crops grown from Summer Seeds.

Crows do not attack crops grown from Summer Seeds, so the use of Scarecrows is unnecessary.
