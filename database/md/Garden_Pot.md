Garden Pot Grows crops from any season when indoors. Outdoors, it can only house seasonal crops. Information Source Crafting Sell Price *Cannot be sold* Crafting Recipe Source Evelyn cutscene after completing the Greenhouse Ingredients Clay (1) Stone (10) Refined Quartz (1)

A **Garden Pot** is a crafted item that allows crops to be grown indoors. It can also be used to grow crops on The Farm or the Ginger Island Farm. The crops can be from any season, except outdoors on The Farm, where they must be from the current season. A Garden Pot cannot grow Ancient Seeds, rejecting them at any time, indoors or outdoors.

After the Greenhouse is completed, Evelyn visits the farm and gives the player one Garden Pot and the recipe for crafting more. The cutscene triggers when the player exits the Farmhouse between 6am and 11:30am on a Sunny day (cannot be windy, rainy, stormy, or snowing), during any season. The event cannot trigger for the first 3 days after the greenhouse is built via completing the Pantry bundles, and it may take longer than 3 days. There is no 3-day delay in triggering the event when repairing the greenhouse via the Joja Community Development Form\[1].

Flowers planted in Garden Pots will enable nearby Bee Houses to produce flower honey.

Crows do not attack crops grown in Garden Pots. Giant crops cannot be grown in garden pots, just as they cannot be grown in the greenhouse.

## Use

Garden Pots can be placed and produce crops "indoors" - that is, in any space not affected by weather. Available locations include the Farmhouse, Island Farmhouse, all farm buildings, The Cave, The Tunnel, The Sewers, the Mutant Bug Lair, the Witch's Swamp, the entrances to The Mines and Skull Cavern, and villagers' homes.

Garden Pots accept crop seeds (other than ancient seeds) in outdoor areas on The Farm or the Ginger Island Farm. They accept only Tea Saplings elsewhere outdoors, however.

Garden Pots do not need to be tilled with a Hoe before planting. Fertilizer of all types may be used in Garden Pots, with the same restrictions and benefits as in tilled soil.

Garden Pots cannot be watered with sprinklers. As a result, players must water crops in Garden Pots on a daily basis with a Watering Can, or less often if they use a type of Retaining Soil. If the player fertilizes the Garden Pot with Deluxe Retaining Soil, the crop needs to be watered only once. Crops that don’t need to be watered such as Tea Saplings and Fiber Seeds don’t need to be watered in the Garden Pot.

Crops in Garden Pots can be harvested with the Iridium Scythe.

Once placed, a Garden Pot may be removed with a tool or by holding left-click. Removing a Pot that contains seeds or crops will destroy the seeds/crops.
