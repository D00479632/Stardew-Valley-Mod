The **Lightning Rod** creates a Battery Pack the day after getting hit by lightning during a storm. It is not necessary for the player to be on the farm when the lightning strike happens.

Lighting Rods also protect The Farm, because lightning that is not intercepted can strike Fruit Trees or destroy Crops, Trees and Farm Debris. Since rods do not protect a specific area, the exact placement of a rod on the farm has no bearing on its chance to intercept a lightning strike. A Lightning Rod has a very good chance of intercepting a lightning bolt if it isn't already processing one.\[1]

After being hit, the Lightning Rod changes to a "processing" state for the remainder of the day and will not intercept any additional strikes, so multiple rods are needed to intercept additional strikes. The number of lightning strikes during one day is random, and increases with higher daily luck.\[2]

A lightning rod is the reward for completing the 10,000 Bundle in the Vault.

## Chance to Intercept

The chance that a lightning strike will be intercepted is inversely related to the percentage of lightning rods on the farm that are currently holding a charge (either pulsing or holding a battery pack). The exact probability is `chance to intercept = 1 - (number of charged lightning rods / total number of lightning rods)²`\[2]. That is, if none of the lightning rods are currently holding a charge, a lightning strike is 100% guaranteed to be intercepted. If 50% of the lightning rods are charged, a lightning strike has a 75% chance to be intercepted. If 90% of the lightning rods are charged, a strike has only a 19% chance to be intercepted. At least one lightning rod must be on the farm to have any chance of intercepting a strike.

A non-intercepted lightning strike has a base 25% chance of hitting a feature on the farm, influenced by daily luck and luck buffs.
