The **Qi Fruit** is a fruit crop that grows from Qi Beans after 4 days. This fruit is only available during the "Qi's Crop" quest. Qi Fruit is one of only five crops that can grow into a giant crop.

All Qi Fruit and Qi Beans despawn when the quest is over (*i.e.,* the day after the player ships them or the quest timer ends), including growing crops, all players' inventories, Chests, Preserves Jars, Kegs, and Marlon's Item Recovery Service list.

Giant Qi Fruit do not disappear when the quest is over, and they can be harvested during future quests to yield more Qi Fruit. If a player chops down a giant Qi Fruit when the "Qi's Crop" quest is not active, then they will receive one Mystery Box instead of fruit. The first time this is done, Mr. Qi will send a taunting message to the player.

Qi Fruit is always normal quality.
