**Hyper Speed-Gro** is a Fertilizer that speeds crop growth by 33% (or a total of 43% with the Agriculturist Profession)\[1]. It can be crafted after purchasing the recipe from Qi's Walnut Room for data-sort-value="30"&gt; 30.

Hyper Speed-Gro can be placed on tilled soil *before or after* planting a seed, or at any stage of crop growth. It does not reduce time between harvests for multi-harvest crops.

Applying Hyper Speed-Gro days after planting a seed still decreases the time it takes to fully grow, but it reduces a fixed amount of days per stage for each crop regardless of the day it's applied, and the reduction in stages that the crop has already passed will not retroactively apply. Combined with the fact that the reduction disproportionately affects earlier stages more, this means that its reduction to the rest of the growth time is much lower than the advertised percentage of 33%.\[2].
