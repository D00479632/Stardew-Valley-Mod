## Locations

- Radioactive Nodes in The Mines during Danger In The Deep quest or after activating the Shrine of Challenge on floor 120 to increase the difficulty.
- Radioactive Nodes in Skull Cavern during Skull Cavern Invasion quest or after activating the statue at the Cavern's entrance.

The chance of finding Radioactive Nodes in either location increases as one goes deeper into the mine, and also with daily luck and luck buffs. It is most strongly affected by Daily Luck, and only slightly affected by depth in the mine and Luck Buffs.\[1]

## Smelting

Radioactive Ore can be smelted in a Furnace to create a Radioactive Bar. The smelting requires 5 Radioactive Ore and 1 Coal and takes 9 hours and 20 minutes in-game time.
