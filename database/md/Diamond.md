Diamond

A rare and valuable gem. Information Source Mining • Monster drop • Fishing Treasure Chests • Panning • Trout Derby • Ice Pip or Stonefish Fish Pond • Statue Of Endless Fortune Sell Price data-sort-value="750 "&gt;750g Gemologist Profession *(+30% Sell Price)* data-sort-value="974"&gt;974g

The **Diamond** is a Mineral that can be obtained primarily from Diamond Nodes and Gem Nodes in the Mines, Skull Cavern, Quarry, and Volcano Dungeon. After reading The Diamond Hunter, any rock has a small chance of yielding a Diamond when mined by hand. Diamonds may also be obtained in a number of other ways.

The Lost Book *A Study on Diamond Yields* contains information about the chances of finding diamond nodes in the mines on a given floor.

A Diamond is arguably the best gem to duplicate in the Crystalarium, providing the largest source of money as a gem. Diamonds are also liked or loved by all giftable NPCs.

If a player has not received 4 candles from Grandpa's Evaluation, then they may be re-evaluated at any time by placing a Diamond into Grandpa's Shrine.
