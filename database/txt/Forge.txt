The Forge Interface
The Forge is located on Floor 10 in the Volcano Dungeon. It is used to upgrade weapons, enchant weapons and tools, combine rings, and change weapon appearances.
After obtaining Combat Mastery, the player can craft a Mini-Forge, which acts exactly the same as this one and can be placed anywhere.

Weapon forging
A melee weapon (dagger, hammer, or sword) can be forged up to three times to improve its stats. Each forge costs one gem and 10/15/20 Cinder Shards depending on how many times it was previously forged.
Using a Diamond as the gem fills all remaining forge levels with random upgrades, but consumes only 10 Cinder Shards.
Note that "level" refers to the number of times a weapon was forged with the specific gem. So for instance, if a weapon was forged with a Ruby, then an Emerald, and then an Amethyst, the weapon stats will have +10% attack power, +2 speed, and +1 weight.
Gem Effect
Amethyst
More knockback (adds 1 per level).
Aquamarine
More critical hit chance (adds a flat 4.6% per level).
Emerald
More weapon speed (adds 2 on the first and third level, 3 on the second level).
Jade
More critical hit damage (adds 10% per level).
Ruby
More damage (adds 10% per level to both min and max damage).
Topaz
More Defense (adds 1 per level).
Enchantments
A random enchantment can be added to any melee weapon or tool, with the exceptions of the Scythe, Golden Scythe, Iridium Scythe, and Trash Can. This costs one Prismatic Shard and 20 Cinder Shards.
A random innate enchantment can be added to any melee weapon, with the exceptions of Galaxy weapons and Infinity weapons. This costs one Dragon Tooth and 10 Cinder Shards.
Each weapon or tool can have only one enchantment and one set of innate enchantments at a time, and the applied enchantments are random. However, another enchantment can be applied (at the same price) to replace an existing one. Tools track the previous two enchantments applied to them so they're not reselected when applying a new enchantment.
Upgrading a tool keeps its enchantment.
Enchantments are determined based on the total number of times the player has enchanted any tool. Therefore, reloading the day and changing the order the tools are enchanted will result in getting different enchantments.
Combat enchantments
Only applies to melee weapons (can't be applied to a slingshot)
Name Effect
Artful 50% cooldown on special moves. (Stacks multiplicatively with Acrobat for a total of 75% cooldown reduction.)[1]
Bug Killer Double damage to grubs, flies, bugs, spiders, & rock crabs. Allows killing armored bugs.
Crusader 50% more damage to mummies, ghosts, skeletons, and void spirits. Allows killing mummies without the use of bombs.
Vampiric 9% Chance to regain some health on kill. Amount healed is 9% to ≈10.67% of monster's maximum health and does not scale with weapon damage.
Haymaker More fiber is earned when collecting weeds. Also a chance to collect hay.
Cutting weeds has a 50% chance of also dropping a fiber, and 33% chance of extra hay (directly into silo on farm, else into inventory).
Innate enchantments
Only applies to low-level melee weapons (can't be applied to Galaxy/Infinity weapons, any weapons with a level of at least 15, or a slingshot). There are 2 sets of innate enchantments. A weapon can have at most one enchantment from each set.
The way the stat-affecting enchantments combine with each other can be nontrivial. See the individual stats' pages for more details.
When enchanting weapons at the forge, one enchantment from this set may be given, but it is not guaranteed:
Name Effect
+1-2 Defense
Defense (+X)
Adds +1 or +2 to the player's Defense stat. Enchant can only be applied if a weapon is level 10 or lower.
−1-5 Weight
Weight (−X)
Decreases weight by 1 to 5, which reduces enemy knockback by 10% to 50%.
Slime Gatherer Increases Slime Dropped from Slime by 1 + random(0, sqrt(slime's max health / 3)). Also triggers when killing Big Slimes. The amount of slime dropped is not affected by any loot-modifying buffs.
When enchanting weapons at the forge, one enchantment from this set is guaranteed:
Name Effect
Slime Slayer Increases damage done to Slime by 33% + 1. Does not affect Big Slimes.
+25-75 Crit. Power
Crit. Power (+X)
Increases critical attack power by 25, 50 or 75. +75 will multiply the damage of a critical strike by 2.5x. See the Crit. Power page for exactly how this is applied.
+1-3 Crit. Chance
Crit. Chance (+X)
Multiplies critical hit chance by 1.02, 1.04, or 1.06, depending on the level. See Combat#Critical hit chance for exactly how this is applied.
+1-5 Attack
Attack (+X)
Adds 1 to 5 to the player's Attack stat. This increases any damage dealt by +3 to +15.
+1-X Speed
Speed (+X)
Decreases weapon swing time by 10% per level. The maximum level depends on the weapon's own speed stat, with (weapon's natural speed + speed enchantment) being capped to at most 4. However, level 1 is always possible, even for fast weapons.

Infinity Weapons
A Galaxy Soul can be forged into a galaxy weapon at the cost of 20 Cinder Shards. Doing this 3 times (at a total cost of 3 Galaxy Souls and 60 cinder shards) will turn the weapon into a more powerful "Infinity" weapon. Adding just 1 or 2 does not affect the weapon. The weapons keep their enchantments and gem forgings when they are made into Infinity weapons. They are given the new Infinity weapon appearance even if they were previously forged into a new appearance.

Weapon Appearance
Two weapons can be merged through the forge. The resulting weapon will have all the stats and info of the first weapon, but the appearance of the second weapon. Only weapons of the same type can be merged. Slingshots cannot be merged. The second weapon will be consumed.
This costs 10 Cinder Shards.
A Galaxy Weapon that changed its appearance in this way would lose its appearance after being forged into an Infinity Weapon.
Combined Rings
Two different rings can be combined into one with stacked effects. This costs 20 Cinder Shards.
This has two restrictions:
Two of the same ring cannot be combined into one. (However, two different rings with the same effect can be combined, like the Glow Ring and Glowstone Ring. Their effects will stack in the same way as wearing both rings separately.)
Three or more rings cannot be combined into one. (i.e., a combined ring can't be further combined).
Unforge
Weapons and combined rings can be unforged to reset its properties.
For a weapon, unforging removes all forge upgrades (but not enchantments) and resets its appearance.
For a combined ring, unforge splits it back into the original rings.
Unforging is free, but only returns some of the Cinder Shards used to forge the item.
To begin the unforging process, place the item for unforging into the left square slot. Then click the red ⨯ symbol near the bottom right corner. The unforged item(s) will appear in inventory, along with any returned Cinder Shards.
Fishing
The Forge is the only floor of the Volcano Dungeon where fishing can occur. It is one of two locations in the game where players can catch Lava Eels. Crab pots cannot be placed in the forge. There is a 5% chance the player can catch a present that contains the painting 'Physics 101'. This painting can only be caught once per player per game.[2]
Secrets
After achieving Perfection, a red monkey can be interacted with to obtain a secret hat.
The plaque above the Forge contains an enciphered message.
An Ancient Doll can be thrown into the lava to obtain a secret item.
