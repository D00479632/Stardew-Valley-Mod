The Trout Derby is a fishing mini festival that occurs on the 20th and 21st of Summer. The festival begins at 6:10am and ends at 2:00am on both days. The festival takes place in Cindersap Forest by the river near Marnie's Ranch. During the festival, players can fish in the river to catch Rainbow Trout, which can be caught all day long and regardless of weather.
Each Rainbow Trout catch (from anywhere with the exception of from a Fish Pond) has a 33% chance to give the player a Golden Tag. This chance is multiplied by the number of Rainbow Trout caught, so it increases to 66% if 2 Rainbow Trout are caught at once and to 99% if 3 are caught at once.[1] Only 1 Golden Tag can be caught per catch even if the player caught multiple Rainbow Trout at once. When a Golden Tag is obtained, if the player did not get a Fishing Treasure Chest it will be caught with the fish itself. Otherwise it will be obtained with the treasure chest that appears while catching the Rainbow Trout. While Golden Tags can be obtained from Rainbow Trouts in other locations, with the exception of Farm Maps with Cindersap Forest fish (Riverland, Hilltop, Forest, and Meadowlands), Rainbow Trout can only be caught with their normal restrictions in these areas.
Golden Tags can be exchanged for prizes at the booth.
Golden Tags carry over from day to day and can be saved for subsequent years.
Unlike other festivals, shops and homes throughout Stardew Valley are not closed on the days of the event, and time continues to pass during the festival. Animals also need to be fed during the event; the game will not automatically consider them to be fed.

Derby Booth
When interacting with the booth, the player can choose to either exchange a Golden Tag for a prize or receive an explanation of the event.
Prizes
The player exchanges Golden Tags 1 by 1 for the available prizes. Each Golden Tag needs to be exchanged individually, even if they have more than one in their inventory.
The first prize the player receives will always be 1 Tent Kit. Afterwards, the player can get one of 10 possible prizes listed below. The first of these prizes is given at random, with the next prize guaranteed to be the one listed next on this list, with 1 Bucket Hat rewarded after 3 Omni Geodes.[2] After receiving all 10 listed prizes, the player will earn the prizes again in the same order.

Come prove your freshwater skills and win prizes!
(Note: Any personal items found near this sign will be sent to the lost and found)”

Other unknown characters from outside of Stardew Valley also participate in the Trout Derby festival. Below is a list of quotes from them.

Tips
Having no luck buffs, low fishing level, and fishing close to the shore will improve the chances of catching Rainbow Trout. The Training Rod will improve the chances as well, although it would only be useful if bait and tackle are unavailable.
The player can craft a Bait Maker to obtain some Rainbow Trout Bait, which will significantly increase the amount of Rainbow Trout the player can catch each day. The player can also bring the Bait Maker to the festival, so more targeted bait can be readily made from the Rainbow Trout caught there.
Using Challenge Bait and getting a perfect catch will almost guarantee getting a Golden Tag, as then 3 Rainbow Trout are caught at once. The player can use Cork Bobbers or Fishing Buffs to increase the size of the fishing bar, making it more likely to get a perfect.
If the player is able to get a perfect catch every single time, using Challenge Bait will get them more golden tags on average than any other bait.
Secret
If Mayonnaise is consumed to recover energy, there is a humorous set of lines that the fishers near the player will say:
“ “Green Shirt Fisher: Gross...”
“ “Green Shirt Fisher: Did you just...?”
“ “Green Shirt Fisher: Why?!”
