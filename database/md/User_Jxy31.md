From Stardew Valley Wiki

Hi! I am an editor that browses this wiki for fun. I am not an official editor and I will only edit things that I find that are not correct .(ex. spook fish producing two different things at once should not be possible, fixed percentage) or else I have another reason. (Trout Soup, Maki Roll?)

Have a good day!
