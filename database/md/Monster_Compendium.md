Monster Compendium Monsters have a small chance to drop double loot. Information Source Monsters • Bookseller Sell Price data-sort-value="2000"&gt;2,000g

The **Monster Compendium** is a power book that can be dropped by monsters. The chance for a monster to drop the book starts at 0.01% and increases by 0.015% for each monster killed until it is dropped. Then the chance stays at 0.05% permanently. It cannot drop until the player has killed more than 10 monsters.\[1]

It can also be purchased from the Bookseller for data-sort-value="20000"&gt;20,000g starting in Year 3 (≈9% chance to appear).\[2]

The first reading grants the player a power that gives all monsters a 3% chance to drop double loot. This effect stacks with that of the Burglar's Ring.\[1] Once read, it can be found in the Player's Menu on the Special Items &amp; Powers tab. Each subsequent reading gives the player 100 Combat XP.
