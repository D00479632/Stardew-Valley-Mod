**Magma Sprites** are an enemy found in the Volcano Dungeon. 150 Magma monsters (either type) need to be killed for the Monster Eradication Goal at the Adventurer's Guild.

## Behavior

Magma Sprites will fly through walls towards the player at high velocities, dealing damage on hit. They are very common, meaning that they, with their stronger counterparts Magma Sparkers, can easily swarm a player who is not equipped with a strong enough weapon.
