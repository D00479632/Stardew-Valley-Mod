Error Item ??? Information Season Â All Sell Price data-sort-value="0"&gt;0g

An **Error Item** is any item whose internal ID doesn't exist in the game's item data. Error items have no associated item data and thus default to purchase/sell prices of data-sort-value="0"&gt;0g, descriptions reading "*???*", and a placeholder ðŸ›‡ sprite.

There are no known ways to produce an Error Item in the latest versions of the base game. However, they can occur due to mods.
