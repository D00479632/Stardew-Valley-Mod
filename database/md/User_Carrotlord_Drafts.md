(*I want to make a table of all the Dried Mushrooms prices using Preserves Jar Productivity and Mushrooms as reference.*)

The amount of energy and health restored from dried mushrooms is 3 times the base mushroom Energy/Health restoration. The sell price of Dried Mushrooms depends on the mushrooms used (7.5 x mushroom Base Price + 25).

Since the Dehydrator requires 5 mushrooms per use, the net advantage of drying mushroom is (1.5x mushroom Base Price + 5) per mushroom used. With the Artisan profession, the benefit is (2.1x mushroom Base Price + 7) per mushroom used.

Since value is based on mushroom Base Price alone, the actual benefit compared to selling the mushrooms will decrease for mushrooms of higher **quality**.

For example, if Artisan profession is not chosen **iridium quality** Mushrooms will generally make a loss if dehydrated and **gold quality** only make a 5g profit per mushroom.

**Note that you may click on a column header to sort the table by that column, then Shift+Click on a second column to perform a secondary sort.**
