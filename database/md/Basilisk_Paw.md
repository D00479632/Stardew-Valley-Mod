The **Basilisk Paw** is a trinket item obtainable after claiming Combat Mastery. It can be obtained by slaying monsters or breaking crates and barrels in the Mines, Skull Cavern, or Quarry Mine. Drop chances from both methods are affected by daily luck and luck buffs, among other factors. The Burglar's Ring and Monster Compendium do not impact the chance to obtain it from monsters.\[1] There is also a ≈0.6% chance to obtain a Basilisk Paw from a treasure chest in the Skull Cavern.\[2]

While the Basilisk Paw is equipped in the trinket slot, the player is completely immune to all debuffs caused by enemies (*e.g.*, Slimed or Jinxed). It does not prevent the self-inflicted Tipsy debuff. The trinket has the same effect as the Squid Ink Ravioli buff.\[3]

The Basilisk Paw cannot be re-forged on an Anvil.
