## Translation

Hello!! Can this template be adapted to Spanish? Because it is on page "recetas de fabricación" and the links they contain lead directly to the pages in English. An idea of ​​mine is that it can be transferred to the Spanish version and ... (if you wish) I can personally translate the links into Spanish, or someone else ... Or would it look like a "sample" in Spanish, but clicking on the links will take them nowhere? Kind regards!! ┌(・。・)┘♪ Viruz PoP (talk) 14:15, 16 March 2021 (UTC)

Hello to you! Yes, the template can and should be translated into Spanish on the Spanish wiki. If you want to do the translations, that would be fantastic! I translated German last night, and others have translated Japanese, Korean, and Portuguese, if you want to look at them to see what they look like. (Just click the language links at the left side of the template). Thank you, and good luck!! margotbean (talk) 17:48, 16 March 2021 (UTC)

## Broken Template

I just saw that this template is broken in all languages, does anyone know why it broke? JaksStrange (talk) 12:31, 15 May 2021 (UTC)

Margotbean moved styling used in this template which is from Mediawiki:Vector.css to single pages, but this template didn't update. So it's broken. I tried to make it work now, but I'm not familiar with css. Anyway, I'll try to update it. Horizon98 (talk) 13:28, 15 May 2021 (UTC)

## Update 1.6

Hello Margotbean, I request your permission again. I still want to update this outdated page. You deleted the Chinese discussion page earlier and said, "template is being deprecated." This template is very useful, and I think it's a pity to abandon it. So can you lift my permission to edit templates? As you mentioned earlier, my previous editing of other templates resulted in the blue link not matching the image position very well. I will try my best to make them fit better this time. I will update the old images used in this template, and then upload the English version of this template first. If you think there are any issues or no issues with the version I uploaded, please reply to me. If there are no issues, I will translate based on this template and upload the remaining 11 language versions.第二个熺 (talk) 05:38, 5 May 2024 (UTC)
