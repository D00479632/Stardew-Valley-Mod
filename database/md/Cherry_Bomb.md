The **Cherry Bomb** is a one-time use explosive item. It damages certain items within its radius. Other items are impervious to its effects.

Cherry Bombs can be crafted or purchased from the Dwarf (both in the Volcano Dungeon and The Mines) for data-sort-value="450"&gt;450g. They can also be dropped by Rock Crabs or Duggies when slain. Fifteen Cherry Bombs may occasionally be found in treasure rooms in the Skull Cavern. Crates and barrels in the "dangerous" Mines or Skull Cavern can drop one. 3-5 Cherry Bombs may occasionally be found in Supply Crates on the Beach Farm if the player has not upgraded the Farmhouse yet. A Cherry Bomb may occasionally be purchased from the Traveling Cart for data-sort-value="50"150–1,000g. Twenty Cherry Bombs can be given as the 10th prize from the prize machine in the Mayor's Manor (33% chance). Kent may randomly send one in the mail as a gift.

If a player has read the Dwarvish Safety Manual, they will take 25% less damage from a Cherry Bomb.

## Effects

Note that the following is not an exhaustive list:

- Rocks and ore/gem nodes will drop their respective ores, gems, etc.
- Mushrooms, Artifact Spots, and foraged minerals will be destroyed.
- Any untilled dirt tiles within a significantly smaller radius will become tilled. In The Mines and Skull Cavern, any items (*e.g.,* clay, artifacts) will be dropped at the same rate as a player using a hoe; elsewhere, nothing will drop (unless the spot in question is the subject of a Secret Note).
- Crafted artisan and refining equipment will be destroyed.
- Heaters will be destroyed.
- Auto-Grabbers will *not* be destroyed, whether empty or containing items.
- Trees will be destroyed when their health reaches zero (ten Cherry Bombs will knock down a fully grown tree, and five more will destroy the stump). Trees will drop wood, sap, and any seeds they contained.

## Radius

The Cherry Bomb has a radius of 3 (diameter of 7) tiles.
