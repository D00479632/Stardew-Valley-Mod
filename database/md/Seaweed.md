**Seaweed** is an item that can be caught using a Fishing Pole in the ocean during all seasons, including a 41% chance to catch Seaweed while fishing in the deep-sea submarine ride at the Night Market. It is never caught in Crab Pots.

It can also be foraged from a narrow strip of shore by the Tide Pools, *i.e.,* to the east of the wooden footbridge\[1], but it spawns relatively infrequently (3% chance per night). The saltwater crab pot fish (Cockle, Crab, Lobster, Mussel, Oyster, and Shrimp) may produce 1-3 Seaweed in a Fish Pond when the population of the pond is at least 1. It's also possible to find Seaweed in the "Dangerous Mines" on floors 1-29 when the Shrine of Challenge is turned on. Seaweed can also randomly be found in Garbage Cans.

Catching Seaweed with a Fishing Pole always gives 3 Fishing XP, and picking up from the beach gives 7 Foraging XP. Seaweed, either fished or foraged, is always normal quality.

Seaweed is displayed in the Fish section of the collection tab, and counts towards the four fishing Achievements.\[2] However, it is otherwise not considered to be a fish, and therefore cannot be sold to Willy at the Fish Shop, does not benefit from fish price bonuses, cannot be used in place of "Any Fish" in recipes, and cannot be put in a Bait Maker, Fish Smoker, or Fish Pond.

One Seaweed can be placed in any Fish Tank as decoration, including the Community Center's fish tank after the fish tank bundle is completed. Its appearance in player-placed fish tanks can be changed by picking up and re-placing the fish tank.
