## Produce

*Main article: Animals#Produce*

Dinosaurs are born mature. A mature and fed dinosaur produces a Dinosaur Egg every 7 days, which can be placed in an Incubator to hatch another dinosaur, or sold for data-sort-value="350"&gt;350g. If you have used the Treasure Appraisal Guide the egg instead sells for data-sort-value="1050"&gt;1,050g.

A Dinosaur Egg can be placed in a Mayonnaise Machine to produce Dinosaur Mayonnaise, which sells for data-sort-value="800"&gt;800g.

## Selling

It is possible to sell the Dinosaur. A Dinosaur with more hearts sells for more gold. A Dinosaur with maximum hearts sells for data-sort-value="1300"&gt;1,300g. A dinosaur with no hearts sells for data-sort-value="315"&gt;315g.

*Note that a dinosaur with 0 hearts of friendship technically sells for data-sort-value="300"&gt;300g, but the player cannot access the 'sell' menu without petting the dinosaur, which gives 15 friendship points (30 with the Coopmaster profession), and increases the sell price to data-sort-value="315"&gt;315g (data-sort-value="330"&gt;330g with Coopmaster).*

To sell a coop or barn animal, right-click the animal after petting. The friendship/mood interface appears. Move the cursor over the gold coin button at the right to see how much the animal can be sold for. Click that button and the confirmation that follows to complete the sale.

## Trivia

- If you talk to Demetrius after hatching a dinosaur, he will get excited about it. So excited that he can't finish his Triple Shot Espresso, which he gives to the farmer instead.
