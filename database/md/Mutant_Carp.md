The **Mutant Carp** is a fish that can be caught in The Sewers during all seasons. It is one of the five Legendary Fish, so it can only be caught once per save file, or once per player in Multiplayer.

There are no special requirements necessary to hook a Mutant Carp; every cast in the sewers has a 10% chance of hooking one (20% chance if using a Curiosity Lure).\[1]

Although the Mutant Carp cannot be hooked again after it is caught, it is possible to obtain multiple Mutant Carp (per player) by using Challenge Bait to catch it.

## Map

The Mutant Carp can be found in The Sewers.

## Strategy

A strategy to catch this fish is to stay in the middle of the fishing minigame area until the fish begins resting somewhere else (such as the bottom or top), then stay there. The fish will move up and down continuously to shake the player off and staying in the middle will allow for a slow but continuous catch.
