Joja Cola Section
Hello! I was wondering why joja cola appears on the "fish and beach forage" section. -- Corndrology (talk) 07:49, 12 November 2021 (UTC)
Hi! I presume it is because it does not fit in any other categories, and can be caught as a trash using a fishing pole (see Joja Cola).

Collapsible tables
Currently some of the tables are quite long lists and it takes quite some scrolling if you are not interested in those categories. Should we perhaps collapse the long tables by default to prevent the page from becoming too big? YuvixAdun (talk) 09:31, 24 March 2024 (UTC)
That ship sailed a long time ago, I'm afraid. On keyboard, "Home" and "End" take you to the top and bottom of the page, where you can use the TOC. On mobile, no table is collapsible, which is where the most benefit would be. margotbean (talk) 16:26, 24 March 2024 (UTC)
Ah, that's a pity YuvixAdun (talk) 17:05, 24 March 2024 (UTC)
Spouse Portraits
Hi I don't see spouse portraits mentioned, am I blind? I'm not confident enough to edit lol Cherrytries (talk) 09:47, 26 March 2024 (UTC)
They haven't been included yet, I tried to but I struggle since their price is fixed and all the prices of Traveling Cart have some range magic around it YuvixAdun (talk) 10:02, 26 March 2024 (UTC)
