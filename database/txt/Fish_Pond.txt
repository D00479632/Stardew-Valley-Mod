The Fish Pond is a type of farm building purchasable from Robin at the Carpenter's Shop. It takes two days to build and occupies a 5x5 tile space.
The following can be placed in a Fish Pond:
All fish caught with a Fishing Rod or a Crab Pot, including Legendary Fish and Legendary Fish II
Coral and Sea Urchin (for simplicity, these are included when referencing fish in a Fish Pond, even though they are otherwise considered forage and not fish)
Golden Animal Cracker, once per Fish Pond to double the fish pond's output of its normal product
The following cannot be placed in a Fish Pond:
Green Algae, Seaweed, White Algae, Sea Jelly, River Jelly, and Cave Jelly, which count towards the Fishing achievements but are otherwise not considered fish
Fish in a Fish Pond have a chance to produce Roe or certain other items. A Golden Animal Cracker can be thrown into the fish pond to double its output. The chance of producing an item and the item produced is determined randomly based on the contents and population of the Fish Pond. Also, fish reproduce up to the limit of their Fish Pond, except Tiger Trout, which do not reproduce. The time it takes for a new fish to spawn varies from 1 to 5 days, depending on the fish.
If a Fish Pond produces any amount of Roe, the game generates a random number between 0 and 1. If it is less than 0.2, the quantity of the Roe produced increases by 1. This repeats until the random number is greater than or equal to 0.2, at which point the chance for the quantity of the Roe to increase ends. This, on average, will give 0.25 extra Roe. This increase is taken into account before the doubling from the Golden Animal Cracker.[1]
Fish can be harvested one at a time by casting the fishing pole into the pond. Harvested fish are always of regular quality (even if higher quality fish were thrown into the pond). Although energy is consumed when casting the rod into the pond, a simplified mechanism is used for catching the fish: fish are caught automatically (without the minigame), no bait is consumed, and the durability of tackle is not depleted. The fish do not count towards the Fish Collection, and no fishing experience is gained by harvesting fish from a pond. However, fishing experience is gained when completing fish pond quests or collecting items produced by a pond.
Each pond holds only one type of fish at a time. Ponds are populated by holding the desired fish (with the inventory menu closed) and right-clicking on the pond to "throw" the fish in. Attempting to throw a fish into a pond that already contains a different type of fish yields a prompt saying that type of fish doesn't want to live in a pond of another type.
Ponds can hold up to a maximum of 10 fish of the same type, except for Legendary Fish and Legendary Fish II, where it can only hold up to 1. The standard initial capacity of a pond is three fish. Several rare fish have an initial capacity of just one fish, namely Blobfish, Ghostfish, Ice Pips, Lava Eels, Slimejacks, Stonefish, Sturgeons, Void Salmons, and Woodskips. Conversely, Tiger Trout, Sea Urchins, and Coral have an initial capacity of ten.

Empty Pond
A fish pond can be emptied either by using a fishing rod to catch and remove each fish or by selecting the “empty pond” option in the fish pond menu.
Catching and removing all the fish simply reduces the pond population but does not reset the pond. Only the same species of fish can be added to the pond. All quest-related capacity increases are retained.
Selecting the “empty pond” option in the fish pond fully resets the pond, returning it to the same state as a newly built pond. Any remaining fish in the pond will flop out. If a Golden Animal Cracker was used on the fish pond, it will permanently disappear.
Quests
Fish in a pond reproduce at a fixed rate until they reach the pond's current capacity. Fish quests allow the player to increase the capacity of the pond, up to a maximum capacity of 10 fish (1 for Legendary Fish and Legendary Fish II).
The fish spawn frequency is species dependent, and ranges from 1 to 5 days (except for Tiger Trout, which does not reproduce). More expensive fish spawn more slowly. Fish will reproduce even if only one fish is present in the pond. Instead of waiting for fish spawning, more fish can be thrown into the pond up to its current capacity.
A new fish quest is initiated when population growth is prevented by the pond capacity. This is indicated by an exclamation point appearing in the center of the pond. A quest is not triggered if the player throws fish into a pond to reach capacity. Instead, the player must wait 1-5 days for the fish quest to start. (Adding fish to the pond does not reset the fish spawning clock, so the next quest will start Spawn_Frequency days after the last spawning event or completed quest). Also, removing fish from a pond with an active quest disables the quest and removes the quest exclamation point, but it does not reset the quest -- as soon as the pond returns to capacity, the quest resumes with the same item requested again.
The fish quests require the player to fetch a specified number of one item and throw it into the pond. If multiples of an item are requested, they are added one at a time, meaning different qualities can be combined. When a quest is completed, the fish will jump out of the pond and thank the player (using one of 19 responses). Also, the player is granted 25-45 Fishing XP (dependent upon the fish spawning frequency, XP = 20 + 5 × Spawn_Frequency).
The possible items depend upon the fish species and the pond capacity. When multiple items are possible for a given quest (or when the number of requested items is variable), the details of the request are randomly selected when the quest initiates. The random selection is seeded based on the fish pond location and day when the quest initiated; reloading a game save will not alter the selection.
The fish population does not immediately increase when a quest is complete. Instead, the fish spawning clock resets to zero days, and the next population increase happens Spawn_Frequency days later. This means that even if a fish quest is completed immediately, the fish population takes more than twice as long to increase each time there is a quest. For example, instead of taking 45 days for an Ice Pip pond to reach a population of 10, it takes at least 69 days (assuming only one initial fish is thrown into the pond).

Produce
Fish ponds may produce items in the chum bucket daily, with items being more likely at higher fish populations. The most common item is Roe, but at high populations, some fish can produce rare or valuable items. A Golden Animal Cracker can be thrown into the fish pond to upgrade and double its output, with a visual indicator of turning the chum bucket golden. This can be reverted by emptying the pond with the “empty pond” option.
Any produced items are collected by clicking on the fish pond. Uncollected items only persist to the next day if new items are not produced; otherwise the new items replace the uncollected items. Collecting an item grants Fishing XP according to XP = 10 + (0.04 × the sell price of the item)
For all ponds besides Legendary Fish and Legendary Fish II ponds, the base chance that an item is possible ranges from 23% to 95% (base_chance = (population of pond × 0.08) + 0.15). Empty ponds never produce items. The game then selects which item will appear, based on the fish species and population. The item-selection can produce no item (especially at low populations), meaning that the overall daily item chance may be much lower than the base 23-95% value. For Legendary Fish and Legendary Fish II ponds, the base chance that an item is possible is 50%.[2]
The table below shows all possible fish pond products, along with the required fish pond population for the item to be possible. The column "% of Items" provides each item's chance as a fraction of all items produced by the pond[3]. The column "Overall Daily Chance" is the chance of the item appearing on a given day, obtained by multiplying the base chance (23-95%) by the "% of Items". Both chances may vary depending upon the fish pond population, as may the possible counts of a given item. More details on all item chances are provided on each individual fish page.

Notes
The decorations around the Fish Pond can be changed only after the pond is populated by at least one fish. Right-clicking on the pond opens a menu where the decorations can be changed. The initial decoration style is chosen randomly when purchasing the pond.
Legendary Fish, Legendary Fish II, Lava Eels, Super Cucumbers, Slimejacks, and Void Salmons change the color of the pond water. For the Legendary Fish and Legendary Fish II, the color change happens overnight. For Lava Eels, the color change happens after the first quest is completed. For the other fish, the color changes when the population reaches 3 (if the third fish is thrown into the pond, the color change happens overnight).
Placing a sign (stone, wood or dark) or a Sign Of The Vessel on the pond will turn it into a counter of how many fish are inside, with a sprite of the fish visible on the sign, and a number in the lower right corner. This number won't be visible for Legendary Fish and Legendary Fish II.
(Clockwise from upper left) Wood Sign, Stone Sign, Dark Sign, and Sign Of The Vessel
Legendary Fish pond water
Legendary Fish II pond water
The pond can be used to refill Watering Cans.
After raising a pond full of 10 Crabs, the next time the player talks to Willy, he will have special dialogue and give the player a Pearl.
Bugs
Colored items like jelly will appear with their default color when thrown into a pond.
If a sign is placed on a fish pond for a fish that triggers a quest at 1 fish, the sign will not show a quantity until after the 1-fish quest is completed.

History
1.4: Introduced.
1.4.4: Fixed bug where Catfish, Octopus, Super Cucumber, and Rainbow Trout fish ponds issued the wrong quests and yielded production and spawns at incorrect rates.
1.5: Added Lionfish, Blue Discus, and Stingray fish ponds.
1.6: Added Goby fish pond. Adjusted Flounder, Midnight Carp, and Lava Eel fish ponds. When resetting a fish pond, existing fish will now flop out instead of simply vanish. Fish Ponds can now be buffed with Golden Animal Crackers and now have a chance to produce extra Roe.
1.6.4: Flopping fish can no longer fall back into fish ponds.
1.6.9: The quantity of the item produced by a Fish Pond is now shown prior to collecting it. Fixed fish ponds accepting multiple golden crackers before the first one lands in the water. Fixed exploit where a Fish Pond with a golden cracker could produce unlimited output. Can now put Legendary Fish and Legendary Fish II into fish ponds.
1.6.13: Signs placed on legendary fish ponds no longer show a "1" under the fish.
1.6.15: Increased roe production rate for Legendary Fish and Legendary Fish II in fish ponds.
