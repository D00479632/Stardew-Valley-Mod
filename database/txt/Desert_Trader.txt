Notes
The Desert Trader does not accept gold, and will explain to the player "Your coin has no value where I come from.... Do you have anything else to trade?"
Sandy mentions the Desert Trader during Emily's visit on her birthday (Fall 15). If the player interacts with her while she is standing in front of the Desert Trader, Sandy says "I think she sells some rare products."
