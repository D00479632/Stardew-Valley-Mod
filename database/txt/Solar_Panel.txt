The Solar Panel is a piece of Refining Equipment that generates 1 Battery Pack the morning after 7 sunny days when placed outdoors (including the day it was placed).[1] The player receives the recipe after completing Caroline's Special Order "Island Ingredients".
Trivia
The solar panel counts sunny days based on the location it is placed. Thus, a solar panel placed down on Ginger Island will not be affected by rain in Stardew Valley, and vice versa.
Arguably the best location to place solar panels is the Calico Desert due to the desert having its own weather (always sunny).
