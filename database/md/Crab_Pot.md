Crab Pot Place it in the water, load it with bait, and check the next day to see if you've caught anything. Works in streams, lakes, and the ocean.

**Crab Pots** are floated on the shores of bodies of water (lakes, ponds, rivers, or oceans) and primed with bait to catch fish. Bait must be inserted every day. Players with the Luremaster profession don't need to add bait.

Harvesting a crab pot gives 5 Fishing experience points, even if trash is caught, the item is normally a Beach forage item, or multiple items were caught in the Crab Pot. Fish caught with crab pots also count towards the four fishing achievements (Fisherman, Ol' Mariner, Master Angler, and Mother Catch).

Crab pots can be crafted or purchased from Willy's Fish Shop for data-sort-value="1500"&gt;1,500g after reaching Fishing level 3. Three crab pots are rewarded for completing the Crab Pot Bundle in the Fish Tank. 1 Crab Pot is also one of the prizes from the Trout Derby festival.

If the player has the power from The Art O' Crabbing book, it gives Crab pots a 25% chance to yield double the amount of items.

## Stages

Crab pots have three stages, which can be distinguished visually:

Image Description The crab pot is empty. Without the Luremaster profession, bait must be added before it will catch anything. The crab pot contains bait, and will catch something the next morning. (The 'empty' image will be seen instead with the Luremaster profession.) The crab pot caught something and can be harvested. An icon of what it contains will appear above the crab pot.

## Specialized Bait

Any type of bait can be used in a crab pot. Using certain types of specialized types of bait will provide additional benefits, assuming the player does not have the Mariner profession:\[1]

- Deluxe Bait decreases the chance of junk (from 38% to 30% in most areas) and increases the quality of Crab Pot fish to silver.
- Wild Bait decreases the chance of junk by the same amount (from 38% to 30% in most areas).
- Using any type of Targeted Bait also decreases the chance of junk by the same amount (from 38% to 30% in most areas). Crab Pot Fish Targeted Bait uses the same decrease for the chance of junk, and also increases the chance to catch that specific Crab Pot fish, decreasing the chance of getting other items which includes decreasing the chance of trash further, down to between 10% to 27% in most areas depending on the Targeted Bait used.
- Magnet, Magic Bait, and Challenge Bait do not provide additional benefits compared to standard bait.

If the player has the Mariner profession, only Deluxe Bait provides an additional benefit, namely still increasing the quality of Crab Pot fish to silver.

## Catch

The day after placing a crab pot, the following items can be found in it:

### Anywhere

Unless the player has the Mariner profession, the following trash items can be obtained by putting a crab pot in any type of water. The chance of trash depends on the location and bait used. Specifically, in all areas except for the Beach Farm pond:

- If the player uses Bait, Magnet, Magic Bait, Challenge Bait, or no bait (with the Luremaster profession only), the chance of trash is 38%.
- If the player uses Deluxe Bait, Wild Bait, or Targeted Bait, the chance of trash decreases to 30%.
- The chance of trash further decreases if the player uses Targeted Bait for a specific Crab Pot fish, down to between 10% to 27% depending on the type of targeted bait used.

On the Beach Farm pond, the chance of trash increases to 57%, 40%, and 22.5-35%, respectively.

All trash items are equally likely to appear.\[2] Trash can be recycled into useful items.

**Note:** If the player has the Mariner profession, the chances of obtaining each fish is equal (at 14.3%) regardless of the bait used or the body of the water the Crab Pot is placed in.

If the player does not have the Mariner profession and uses either Deluxe Bait, Wild Bait, or any type of Targeted Bait (except for Crab Pot saltwater fish), the percent chance of obtaining each Crab Pot item is multiplied by 1.125 in the table above. The table below shows the chance of getting each item if Targeted Bait for Crab Pot saltwater fish is used and the player does not have the Mariner profession.\[3]

### Freshwater

The following creatures can be caught by putting a crab pot into any freshwater location.\[2]

Farm Ponds will yield Crab Pot Fish, even ponds where a Fishing Rod can only catch trash. Crab Pots also work in all underground locations (*e.g.,* The Sewers). The pools found in the Mines are the only exceptions. While Crab Pots can be placed in the mine’s pools, they will vanish and be permanently lost after leaving the level. Crab Pots cannot be placed into fountains (*e.g.,* in Pelican Town or outside the Spa).

On the Beach Farm pond, if the player does not have the Mariner profession, the percent chance of obtaining each Crab Pot item is multiplied by 0.69 in the table above, as trash is more likely to be caught there.\[4] If the player does not have the Mariner profession and uses either Deluxe Bait, Wild Bait, or any type of Targeted Bait (except for Crab Pot freshwater fish), the percent chance of obtaining each Crab Pot item is multiplied by 1.125 in the table above. On the Beach Farm pond, the percent chance of obtaining each Crab Pot item chance is multiplied by 0.97 in the table above, or by 1.405 for the modified percentages, taking into account the previous 0.69 multiplier. The table below shows the chance of getting each item if Targeted Bait for Crab Pot freshwater fish is used and the player does not have the Mariner profession in all areas except for the Beach Farm pond. For the Beach Farm pond, the percent chance of obtaining each Crab Pot item is multiplied by 0.861 in the table below, with the percent chance of trash adjusted accordingly.\[3]

## Dyeing

Crab Pot can be used in dyeing, serving as an orange dye at the dye pots, located in Emily's and Haley's house, 2 Willow Lane.

## Gold per Day

Crab pots make on average data-sort-value="47"&gt;47g/day in freshwater and data-sort-value="50.5"&gt;50.5g/day in the ocean, assuming all trash is recycled and sold. This number can be increased to about data-sort-value="75"&gt;75g/day for freshwater or data-sort-value="85"&gt;85g/day for the ocean if all fish that are worth less than data-sort-value="75"&gt;75g are converted into Sashimi and the Mariner profession is chosen. Note that all of these numbers are multiplied by 1.25 if the player has the power obtained from The Art O' Crabbing.\[5]

## Tips

- Because the freshwater catches sell for a low value and can be easily caught in large quantities, they're ideal choices for turning into Quality Fertilizer or Sashimi. It might be helpful to put a handful of crab pots in the farm's ponds (where they're easily accessible to harvest daily) to make fertilizer/sashimi out of their catches and gain some Fishing experience.
- When the Luremaster Profession is taken, it becomes easier to accidentally pick up the crab pots. Since 1.5, this has become easier to avoid; simply target a crab pot that still contains its daily catch, and hold the collection button. As long as the button is held, the player can collect as many as they like without fear of accidentally picking up the crab pot. Since 1.6.4 this is even easier to avoid, as there is now a short delay after collecting when the crab pot cannot be picked up.
  
  - Without the profession, the easiest way is to have the bait selected as the crab pots are emptied, easily baiting the pot right away. Baited Crab Pots cannot be picked up.
- Without the Trapper profession, the total cost of buying materials to build a crab pot is data-sort-value="3100"&gt;3,100g. With the profession, the total cost of materials is data-sort-value="1300"&gt;1,300g. However, these prices more than double starting in Year 2 due to the rise in the cost of raw materials, while the purchase price from Willy's Fish Shop remains fixed at data-sort-value="1500"&gt;1,500g. This makes it much more cost-effective to buy crab pots from Willy's starting in Year 2 instead of buying the ingredients, even with the Trapper profession.
