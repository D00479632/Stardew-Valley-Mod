The Leek is found via foraging in the Spring, or grown from Spring Seeds. The Statue Of Endless Fortune produces one Leek per year on George's birthday, Fall 24. It can randomly be found in Garbage Cans during Spring.
Leeks are most common on the Mountain and Backwoods maps, where 58% of spring forage items will be Leeks. They can also be found at the Bus Stop (20%), Railroad (20%) and the Forest Farm (25%).
