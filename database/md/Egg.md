## Tailoring

Egg can be used in the spool of the Sewing Machine to create the dyeable Plain Overalls. Both colors of eggs can be used as a white dye when used in the spool of the Sewing Machine with a dyeable clothing item in the feed.

## Quests

- An Egg may be randomly requested during any season at the "Help Wanted" board outside Pierre's General Store for a reward of data-sort-value="150"&gt;150g and 150 Friendship points. This will only be requested if the player owns a White Chicken, Brown Chicken, or Duck. However, owning a Duck will still result in a chicken egg being requested.
- "Gus' Famous Omelet": On the Special Orders board in front of the Mayor's Manor, Gus may randomly request that the player collect and deliver 24 Eggs (of any type) to the fridge in the Stardrop Saloon. The reward is data-sort-value="3000"&gt;3,000g and a Mini-Fridge.
- Five Eggs (any type, excluding Dinosaur) may be requested by the Raccoon at the Giant Stump as part of his third request, or as part of any request starting with the sixth.
