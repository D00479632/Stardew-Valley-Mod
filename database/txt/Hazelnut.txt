The Hazelnut is found via foraging throughout Stardew Valley in the Fall. It can also be grown from Fall Seeds. Shaking a Maple Tree from the 15th through 28th of Fall has a chance to cause a hazelnut to drop from the tree. Five Hazelnuts can be purchased from Kent's shop at the Desert Festival for 10 Calico Eggs each. Hazelnut can also randomly be found in Garbage Cans during Fall.
