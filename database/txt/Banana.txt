The Banana is a fruit produced each day by a Banana Tree during its harvest season. A Banana Tree on the Farm in Stardew Valley produces fruit during Summer. On Ginger Island or in the Greenhouse, it produces fruit year-round.
A Blue Discus Fish Pond has a 5-15% chance of producing a banana daily once the population of the pond reaches 4.
