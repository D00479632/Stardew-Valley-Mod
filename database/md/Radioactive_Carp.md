The **Radioactive Carp** is one of the five Legendary Fish that must be caught for Mr. Qi's Extended Family Quest. It has the same sell price, healing effect, location, and chance of hooking as the Mutant Carp. It can only be caught when the quest is active, but more than one can be caught per quest.
