## Trivia

- In real life, iridium is a rare silver, brittle metal that can be hazardous in a fine dust and has toxic radioactive isotopes. It is often used to produce hard, durable surfaces for high-precision tools and machine parts. It is the second densest element on the periodic table, being almost twice as dense as lead.
