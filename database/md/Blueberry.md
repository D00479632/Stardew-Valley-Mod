## Fertilizer

Basic Fertilizer and Quality Fertilizer only affect the first berry from every harvest, which means 2 out of 3 berries harvested from each bush are going to be regular quality crops. That makes Speed-Gro an optimal fertilizer for this crop, as it gives one extra harvest before the Fall (assuming planting on day 1 of the summer), increasing season earnings from Blueberry by 25% compared to at most 6% with Quality Fertilizer.\[1]

Deluxe Speed-Gro yields the same number of harvests as regular Speed-Gro, usually at a higher cost. (One exception is purchasing Deluxe Speed-Gro from the Oasis for data-sort-value="80"&gt;80g vs. purchasing Speed-Gro from Pierre's General Store for data-sort-value="100"&gt;100g.)
