## My Stardew Valley interests

I enjoy playing Junimo Kart, chatting with villagers, and farming with cows. My favourite villager is Shane!

I play on PS5 and I am so excited for November 4th when 1.6 releases on consoles and when ConcernedApe will continue working on Haunted Chocolatier! That will be my next favourite game!

## A Note for Beginners

If you are a new editor, I strongly suggest reading help:editing before you make any edits. When I was starting out, I made the mistake of not reading it, and got banned. Please, go and read it so the same thing doesn't happen to you!
