The **Ring of Yoba** is a ring that can be crafted after earning the recipe at Combat Level 7. The ingredients are: 5 Iron Bars, 5 Gold Bars, and 1 Diamond.

The Ring of Yoba has a chance of giving the Yoba's Blessing buff after the player takes damage. The Yoba's Blessing buff grants immunity to monster-based damage for 5 seconds. It does not protect against damage caused by falling down Skull Cavern shafts.

The chance of receiving the buff is increased by low health and by Luck buffs, but not daily Luck. It can activate once the player's health drops below 90. After that, it increases linearly until 15 health, below which an additive 20% bonus to the activation chance applies. This is calculated\[1] as `(0.9 - HP / 100) / (3 - floor(Luck Level / 10)) + Bonus` where `Bonus` is 0.2 if health is 15 or less. For 0 Luck and 100 max health, this means 50-45% activation chance between 0 HP and 15 HP and 25%-0% activation chance between 16 HP and 90 HP.

Equipping a second Ring of Yoba provides no additional benefit.\[2]
