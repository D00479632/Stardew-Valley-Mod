The Silo is a type of farm building purchasable from Robin at the Carpenter's Shop. It takes two days to build. When complete, it stores hay from grass cut on the farm.
Behavior
Each silo can store up to 240 hay. The current amount stored can be checked by interacting with it. If the player owns multiple silos, it shows the combined total storage and capacity of all silos on The Farm.
Hay stored in the silo is accessible through the hay hoppers located inside Coops and Barns to be used for feeding their respective animals. The distance between the silo and the animal buildings does not affect the operation of the hay hoppers.
Hay can be added to the silo in a number of ways:
When the Player cuts grass on their farm with the scythe, there is a 50% chance that 1 hay is added to the silo (75% if cut with the Golden Scythe, 100% if cut with the Iridium Scythe).
Cutting weeds with melee weapons enchanted with "Haymaker" also has a 33% chance of dropping a hay (directly into silo, else into inventory).
When the Player has hay in their inventory, hay can be added to the silo by left- or right-clicking on the silo while holding the hay.
Hay can also be added to the silo by clicking the hay hoppers while holding the hay.
Tips
The silo is a good choice as a first building to be purchased. It takes fewer resources to build than other buildings, and allows a good stock of hay to be gathered before actually having to meet the needs of any animals.
Instead of buying multiple silos, hay can be stored in a chest (when received as a gift in the mail from Marnie or withdrawn from the Hay Hopper before a Coop or Barn is fully upgraded). Hay can be moved from the chest to the Silo when necessary.
The current amount of hay stored can also be checked at the Farm Computer.
Since grass stops growing and provides less hay on average in Winter, and farm animals will entirely rely on hay for the whole season, it's advisable to cut as much grass as needed to fill the silo(s) near the end of fall, even if it takes all the grass left on the farm.
To avoid purchasing hay in the winter, you will need 26 hay stored per animal (animals consume no food during the Festival of Ice or Feast of the Winter Star). 1 silo can feed 9 animals, so a total of 3 silos would be needed to feed the 24 animals of a full Deluxe Barn and Deluxe Coop for the season.
Hay can also be obtained when harvesting Wheat. However, hay obtained this way does not automatically go into the silo, but into the player's inventory.
History
1.6: Grass grown outside no longer disappears on the first day of Winter. Through the winter, it goes dormant and provides less hay when cut.
