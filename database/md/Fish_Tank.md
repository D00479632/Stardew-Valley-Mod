## Use

Certain items can be added to the fish tank to change its appearance by holding the item and right-clicking on the tank. To get a list of the items inside or to remove them, right-click on the tank with empty hands. The location and appearance of the decorations and any stationary animals placed inside is random and can be changed without removing items by picking up and re-placing the tank.

## Types

There are 7 types of fish tanks. The Small Fish Tank, Modern Fish Tank, Large Fish Tank, and Deluxe Fish Tank are available from the Furniture Catalogue and the Deluxe Fish Tank is available in Willy's shop only after completing the Tropical Fish special order. The Jungle Tank is only available from the Raccoon after its 5th request. The Community Center Fish Tank is only available after the Fish Tank bundles are completed (which turns the broken fish tank into a working fish tank) and cannot be obtained in any other way, nor can it be picked up to change the location or appearance of static decor placed in it. The Aquatic Sanctuary is only available from Qi's Walnut Room and cannot be found in the Furniture Catalogue.

## Animations

Most of the swimming creatures either move around without animating (*e.g.,* Pufferfish, Octopus) or move their tails / rear parts of their bodies at various speeds while swimming. However, some of the swimming creatures have unique animations:

- Eels and Lava Eels undulate up and down like a dolphin or whale (rather than side to side like an eel or other fish).
- Squids and Midnight Squids push with their tentacles much like the Blue Squid found in the mines with the Shrine of Challenge active.
- Stingrays flip their fins up and down as well as moving their tails.

For the bottom creatures, Frogs have unique animations for hopping around and inflating their vocal sacs.
