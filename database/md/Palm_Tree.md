Palm Tree

Information Seed None Tapper Product N/A Growth Time Variable

A **Palm Tree** is a type of Tree found in the Calico Desert and on Ginger Island. It does not drop any seeds, so it cannot be planted elsewhere. It can be chopped down, and may drop a Coconut when shaken or chopped down (but only after the player has reached Foraging level 1). Palm Trees on Ginger Island can also drop Golden Coconuts. After being chopped down, a Palm Tree has approximately a 20% chance to grow to the next stage each day.
