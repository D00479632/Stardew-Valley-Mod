Solid Gold Lewis Mayor's secret project. Information Source(s) Secret Note #19 Sell Price Cannot be sold

The **Solid Gold Lewis** statue can be obtained by solving the puzzle depicted in Secret Note #19.

If the original is lost, a replacement can be purchased at the Lost Items Shop in the Secret Woods for data-sort-value="10000"&gt;10,000g.

Placing the Statue anywhere in Pelican Town results in an additional secret.

Details  If the statue is not destroyed by any villagers walking through it, the next day it will be replaced with a Rotten Plant, and the player will receive an unsigned letter in the mail containing data-sort-value="750"&gt;750g:

“ “&lt;Player&gt;

In the future, I'd appreciate it very much if you refrained from placing my PRIVATE belongings in town for all to see!

I'm very displeased!

Take this money and never speak of my 'project' to anyone.”

The statue will then appear in Lewis' bedroom (90% chance) or Marnie's bedroom (10% chance).

The statue can be removed and placed in Pelican Town again and again, and each time it will be replaced by a Rotten Plant. The player will receive the unsigned letter only once, however.
