A Ruby can also be obtained from Dwarvish Sentries (10% chance), in Fishing Treasure Chests, by panning, or as a gift at the Feast of the Winter Star. It can be found in crates and barrels in the Mines (Floors 80+), Skull Cavern, and Volcano Dungeon. It may also occasionally be found in a Garbage Can after the player has reached the bottom of the Mines.
