Behavior
They will move suddenly as well as hover over rocks, and shoot fireballs at the player, which ricochet off walls.
Strategy
Simply move in quickly and hit them. They have only 1 health, and can be defeated with a single hit from any weapon. A Slingshot can be used with any ammo to safely kill them from a distance. Their fireballs can also be hit and destroyed; however, fireballs will not be stopped by a sword's secondary attack.
