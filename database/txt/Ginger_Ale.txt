Tailoring
Ginger Ale is used in the spool of the Sewing Machine to create the Ginger Overalls. It can be used in dyeing, serving as a green dye at the dye pots, located in Emily's and Haley's house, 2 Willow Lane.
Notes
Ginger and ginger ale are common remedies for nausea. Though it is not specifically noted in-game, eating Ginger or drinking Ginger Ale cures the Nauseated debuff. This is hinted at by Birdie, the pirate's wife who lives on Ginger Island.
