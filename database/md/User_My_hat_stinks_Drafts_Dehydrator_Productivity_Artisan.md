This page lists the productivity of processing Fruits and Mushrooms into Artisan Goods in a Dehydrator.

The products produced usually sell for more than the raw input items, so using a Dehydrator is almost always profitable. Items that lose gold are highlighted in red, and items whose net increase in value is zero are highlighted in orange. The profit made from processing items is lowest when using iridium quality and highest when using regular quality items.

This table shows the profitability of processing items when the player has chosen the Artisan Profession (note that the Tiller Profession is a prerequisite for the Artisan Profession so both are taken into account here). To view the profitability for no profession or the Tiller Profession, use the links at the top of the page.

**Note that you may click on a column header to sort the table by that column, then Shift+Click on a second column to perform a secondary sort.**
