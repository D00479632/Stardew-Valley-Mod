This page lists the productivity of processing Wine, Cheese, Goat Cheese, Pale Ale, Mead, and Beer in a Cask.

With the exception of the two highest-value wines, cheeses give the best value compared to the processing time required to age them to iridium quality. The best value wines are included in the table below along with all unique cask products.

Name Processing Time  
(Iridium) Value Increase  
(Reg. to Iridium) Gold/Day Value Increase  
(Reg. to Iridium)  
(Artisan Prof.) Gold/Day  
(Artisan Prof.) Starfruit Wine 56 Days 2250g 40.2 3150g 56.3 Ancient Fruit Wine 56 Days 1650g 29.5 2310g 41.3 Goat Cheese 14 Days 400g 28.6 560g 40.0 Cheese 14 Days 230g 16.4 322g 23.0 Pineapple Wine 56 Days 900g 16.1 1260g 22.5 Melon Wine 56 Days 750g 13.4 1050g 18.8 Rhubarb Wine 56 Days 660g 11.8 924g 16.5 Pale Ale 34 Days 300g 8.8 420g 12.4 Banana or Crystal Fruit Wine 56 Days 450g 8.0 630g 11.3 Peach or Pomegranate Wine 56 Days 420g 7.5 588g 10.5 Beer or Mead 28 Days 200g 7.1 280g 10.0 Mango Wine 56 Days 390g 7.0 546g 9.8 Grape Wine 56 Days 240g 4.3 336g 6 Strawberry Wine 56 Days 360g 6.4 504g 9.0 Followed by all other wines in descending order of fruit/wine price.

Note that although the large milks make gold quality cheeses directly, the final aging step is both 50% of the total value increase and 50% of the required time, so the g/day remains the same. The prices above assume no relevant skills. Choosing Artisan raises the base prices of all cask-aged products by the same percentage, so while the overall values will increase, the relative order of g/day stays the same. Choosing Rancher, however, will only increase the price of the cheeses, raising Cheese to ≈19.7 g/day and Goat Cheese to ≈34.3 g/day, making it better than Ancient Fruit Wine in this case.
