Hi. I'm now Giles. (I was Butterbur). I've been around here since 31 Dec 2016, at 17:31 (UTC). If you read stuff on this page, may it prove useful, entertaining, or enjoyable for you. Might I suggest the notes on naming your horse as the likeliest to succeed? But my primary purpose is for my own use and record, so may you not be disappointed. 03:20, 30 March 2021 (UTC)

## Take Your Pick (Mining Output)

The following collapsible tables provide information about gathering items with the Pickaxe, starting from the sources of these items rather than the items themselves. Each table focuses on one category of sources. Each source is identified by its appearance (icons) and the locations in which it may be found. The performance of the various grades of Pickaxe is given as a count of the strokes it takes to break up a source into items. Performance can vary by source type, source location, and Pickaxe grade.

The yields from breaking up an object can vary, sometimes randomly, and sometimes influenced by mining skill or profession. Some yields are a guaranteed minimum; others are not. One source object sometimes yields multiple items, or even multiple types of items. These quantities are impossible to quantify with accuracy, and statistical probabilities require examination of the random generators in the game code. I find those analyses to be minimally useful in game play, at best. I think it is better to understand which game aspects exert influence on the average outcomes, and which source objects tend to provide the superior yields (if any). This information is summarized in the introductions to each table, for its category of sources. 18:00, 2 October 2020 (UTC)

Original Table  This "original" table was lifted from a rejected edit of the article on Pickaxes. I used it to seed my tables, but I suspect it contained a few errors, some of which likely found their way into mine. From the start I have been correcting or editing as I see the opportunity, a process I will continue over time. 18:00, 2 October 2020 (UTC)
