Artisan Goods are items that can be created using Artisan Equipment. They can take anywhere from a few hours to a few days (in-game time) to be processed.
For most Artisan Goods, the star quality of the ingredients used is ignored. The only exceptions are Mayonnaise made from an Ostrich Egg, and Smoked Fish. For these products, the star quality of the artisan product will match that of the ingredient. Additionally, while Cloth does not have a star quality itself, it is affected by the quality of the Wool used, with higher quality wool resulting in higher chances to produce 2 cloth instead of 1.
If the Artisan Profession is chosen after reaching level 10 Farming, Artisan Goods will be worth 40% more (with the exception of Oil and Coffee). Tree Syrups (Maple Syrup, Oak Resin, Pine Tar, and Mystic Syrup) do not benefit from the Artisan Profession, and are not included here. They are labeled as "Artisan Goods" in-game, however. (Their value is instead affected by the Tapper Profession.) In multiplayer games, if any connected player has the Artisan profession, all items sold will get the boosted price.
One Artisan Good, the Piña Colada, can be obtained only from the Island Resort on Ginger Island on Sundays when Gus tends the bar there.

Production Machines
Production machines make products over time without any additional input.
Bee House
Main article: Bee House
A Bee House produces Wild Honey every 4 days.
The Bee House can produce unique types of honey when it is in range of a blooming flower (within 5 tiles in any cardinal direction). When there is more than one type of flower within range, the closest flower takes priority. Flowers placed in garden pots will also cause bee houses to produce flower honey.
Bee houses can be placed inside the Greenhouse, but will not produce honey.
