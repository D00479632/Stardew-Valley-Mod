Magnet Increases the chance of finding treasures when fishing. However, fish aren't crazy about the taste.

The **Magnet** is a type of bait that increases the chance of finding treasure chests by 15% (30% chance base instead of 15% base). It can be crafted or purchased from Willy's Fish Shop for data-sort-value="1000"&gt;1,000g after reaching fishing level 9. It can also be purchased from the Casino for data-sort-value="1000"&gt;1,000. It can also be found in Golden Fishing Treasure Chests (7% chance).\[1]

It is received as one of the prizes for winning the Ice Fishing Contest at the Festival of Ice for the first time, and can also be received as a gift from Willy at the Feast of the Winter Star. It may also randomly appear in Krobus' shop on Wednesdays for data-sort-value="200"&gt;200g, or at the Traveling Cart for data-sort-value="15"100–1,000g.

Magnets cannot be used with the Training Rod or the Bamboo Pole. Only the Fiberglass Rod, the Iridium Rod, and the Advanced Iridium Rod can use bait. Magnets can also technically be used in a Crab Pot, but it is no better than standard bait as crab pots never yield any treasure.
