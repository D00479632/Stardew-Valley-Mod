## Behavior

They slowly move around the cave floor and belch flame blasts at the player when they get too close. While breathing fire, they do not deal contact damage.

## Strategy

Pepper Rexes pause their movement and continually shoot in one direction when attacking. Use this time to quickly side step the fire and begin attacking them.

During the pause in movement before their attack, Pepper Rexes can quickly turn around if the player moves to one of their sides too quickly. The best strategy to counter this is to stand diagonally next to the Pepper Rex until it begins its attack, and then attack the side they are not shooting from.
