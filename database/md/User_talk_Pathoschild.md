## User page carryover

I noticed a red link to User:Pathoschild/Modding wishlist, which apparently wasn't carried over from the old page on the previous domain. Was skipping over userspace pages like this one an intentional part of the transition process, or an oversight?

I guess it might make sense for editors to personally choose what pages to keep, but it might be annoying for people with many subpages. RetroEdit (talk) 18:00, 19 February 2021 (UTC)

Hi! I just copied all my subpages over. I'm not sure why user pages weren't transferred, but apparently there were technical/legal restrictions on what they could transfer. ‚ÄîPathoschild (talk) 18:43, 19 February 2021 (UTC)

Ah, I see.

I would guess it's related to "And, in accordance with privacy laws, no personal information will be transferred during this move \[the wiki transfer]" from ConcernedApe's blog post. Perhaps userspace pages were considered personal information? Although, I also infer the accounts themselves were transferred over, so that seems somewhat inconsistent to me.

But it's not directly relevant to me anyway as a new editor here. I guess I was just curious. RetroEdit (talk) 19:13, 19 February 2021 (UTC)

I'm not sure any user info was transferred, aside from the actual usernames. I think it might sync (some of) your user info from the old wiki the first time you login here. That might be why watchlists were reset for example. That's just a guess though, I don't have any internal info about the transfer. ‚ÄîPathoschild (talk) 19:40, 19 February 2021 (UTC)

## Old Wiki Lifetime

Cole informed me that the old wiki has no set lifetime, but "they" plan to keep it around as long as possible. (I think "they" means ChuckleFish). To me, this says that the old wiki could potentially disappear without warning at any time. So, we can either make sure every page is archived on the wayback machine, or go with your template and archived pages. (I choose the second option üòõ)

I've restored the admin noticeboard archive and removed the delete tag from the template. I'm not sure we need all the Admin noticeboard history, but having the last several comments doesn't hurt. Creating redlinks does hurt my OCD a bit, but we can deal with those over time. Good? margotbean (talk) 07:05, 21 February 2021 (UTC)

Sounds good to me! I prefer having the archives on-wiki too, and the redlinks are still useful for finding the user's edits &amp; talk page. If needed we could create a placeholder template for user pages to turn them blue, or tweak the stylesheets so links to valid-but-not-created user pages are a gentler shade of red/blue. ‚ÄîPathoschild (talk) 07:26, 21 February 2021 (UTC)

## Adding CurseForge Mod Repository to list of mod sites with Stardew Valley Mods

Referred here by MargotBean:

‚Äú ‚ÄúHello! revision 117428 by Gilgamsh0n (talk) with the reason 'I know nothing about this site.' on 01:54, 22 February 2021 (UTC)

I provided a link to the repository which has 48 SV mods, some of them unique to my knowledge (DarkHax authored mods). would be neat if you could revert this change, CurseForge is a legit repository for mods for a variety of games, and SV mods are very welcome there! Gilgamsh0n (talk) 14:55, 22 March 2021 (UTC)

DarkMax should consider hosting their mods on nexus or the official forums in addition to the site which I still know nothing about. Please remember to place new text at the bottom of the page. margotbean (talk) 14:59, 22 March 2021 (UTC)

Appologies about placing the text at the top! What would be required for you to know more about the site, other than the fact it has mods for many games including SV? Glad to provide more info, it's by no means a small website. www.curseforge.com for your convenience. Gilgamsh0n (talk) 15:28, 22 March 2021 (UTC)

Please place a message on Pathoschild's talk page, he may be more familiar with the website than I am. margotbean (talk) 14:59, 23 March 2021 (UTC)‚Äù

Would be great if it could be reviewed and restored/added, happy to provide more info if you wish. Gilgamsh0n (talk) 18:10, 23 March 2021 (UTC)

Hi! Based on the mod compatibility data, only 13.7% of CurseForge's SMAPI mods (i.e. nine mods by three authors) are compatible and aren't already on a more popular site. So while SMAPI itself supports CurseForge, I think it's too small and has too many broken mods to recommend to first-time players in the 'getting started' guide (especially with no way to indicate on CurseForge that a mod is broken). CurseForge mods are already listed in the mod index though, so it's still discoverable. ‚ÄîPathoschild (talk) 19:07, 23 March 2021 (UTC)

## Orphaned Modding page

**Modding:IDE reference:JetBrains Rider** has been a stub (and an orphaned page) since Dec. 17, 2019. Do you think it can be deleted? Or, should it be left alone? Or something else? Thank you! margotbean (talk) 18:36, 22 November 2021 (UTC)

Logically, I presume it should be integrated (or at least linked) in the Modding:IDE reference page. I would say it could be useful for people used to JetBrains' IDEs but I not aware at all if the page is up to date. -- Charly (talk) 18:48, 22 November 2021 (UTC)

We'll need to rewrite our main IDE docs soon, since MonoDevelop is dead and the upcoming Stardew Valley 1.5.5 will switch to .NET 5 + MonoGame on all platforms. I've been using Rider on Linux for a while now; so when I redo the docs for the 1.5.5 release, I'll switch MonoDevelop to Rider in the main guide. I guess we can keep the subpage temporarily until that happens? ‚ÄîPathoschild (talk) 20:59, 22 November 2021 (UTC)

Thanks so much, I'll mark it for deletion now and delete it after v1.5.5 (and the updates to the modding pages). margotbean (talk) 20:53, 23 November 2021 (UTC)

## 1.5.5 hotfix link

Small potatoes, but did you notice that the hotfix is listed at the bottom of the main blog post for the v1.5.5 release? It goes into more detail than the tweet, so I used the forum link instead of the twitter link. margotbean (talk) 00:36, 4 December 2021 (UTC)

Thanks! I hadn't noticed them down there. I tweaked the section to link to both; how does that look? ‚ÄîPathoschild (talk) 00:39, 4 December 2021 (UTC)

Looks complete, and a little bit like you may have had too much caffeine today. Pardon me while I run away fast now.¬†;)

Seriously, it looks fine. Remember to take breaks now and then. XO, margotbean (talk) 00:46, 4 December 2021 (UTC)

## Game speed

Hey there, I noticed in an edit to the day page you changed the length of a day from 14:20 min (860sec) as it said previously to 14:00 (840s) and the corresponding rate of time to 0.716s to exactly 0.700s. You did point out in the edit summary that this was more accurate, so I'll take your word about that until I can set aside some time to test, but I just wanted to confirm that this was intentional because most other sources I've seen have said "about 0.7" and not exactly 0.700. Thanks in advance! Techhead7890 (talk) 19:58, 22 May 2022 (UTC)

Hi! The online info is mostly based on players experimenting in-game, which can be imprecise. The edit is based on the decompiled game code instead, in particular these `Game1` constants used in the time code:

```
public const int realMilliSecondsPerGameMinute = 700;
public const int realMilliSecondsPerGameTenMinutes = realMilliSecondsPerGameMinute * 10;
```

and this `MineShaft` method for the Skull Cavern adjustment (the Skull Cavern is mine area 121, and despite the name this is the extra milliseconds per in-game *ten minutes*):

```
public override int getExtraMillisecondsPerInGameMinuteForThisLocation()
{
    if (Game1.IsMultiplayer)
        return base.getExtraMillisecondsPerInGameMinuteForThisLocation();
    if (this.getMineArea() != 121)
        return 0;
    return 2000;
}
```

## v1.6 Graphic

I had a thought: If we change the version number to v1.6 with the new code, won't we need a new graphic for the main page? ...Maybe something to discuss w/CA when the time comes. Or maybe we leave the image as is for when it rolls out to the other platforms, but eventually replace it with something without version numbers.¬†?? ü§î margotbean (talk) 19:20, 15 September 2022 (UTC)

ConcernedApe might create an image for the 1.6 announcement post (like he did for 1.5). If not, it'd be pretty easy to just edit out the hanging '1.5' sign, or maybe one of our pixel modders could create a new image for the wiki. ‚ÄîPathoschild (talk) 01:35, 16 September 2022 (UTC)

## Notes for Mobile Version History aren't matching up with official release notes as of build 34 onwards

Hi - the official forum thread for mobile version 1.5 also lists the patches as they are released and these are taken directly from ConcernedApe's twitter, however you have build 34 listed on the mobile version history which doesn't match up with the January 11 patch notes, take a look here for the forum thread: https://forums.stardewvalley.net/threads/report-1-5-mobile-issues-here-updated-jan-11.14953/

This is going to confuse people. I see that you obtained the latest notes from a decompile. I think it would be best if the Wiki only contained the official patch notes from ConcernedApe. What's your opinion?  
‚ÄîMrJunimo (talk) 12:27, 11 January 2023‚Äé (UTC)

Hi! That forum post shows release notes for 1.5.6.32/33/35, and silently skips 1.5.6.34. It's not unusual for an update to have missing or incomplete release notes, which is one of the reasons the wiki isn't just a copy &amp; paste of the official notes. It does link to the announcement (when there is one) so you can see the original release notes (if any). I added 1.5.6.35 to the wiki and asked Magically Clueless to add version numbers to her post though, which should both reduce confusion. Thanks for pointing it out! ‚ÄîPathoschild (talk) 17:53, 11 January 2023 (UTC)

## SpriteText font not loaded when changing to custom language

Found a bug in game code for custom language.

**To Reproduce**  
Suppose the custom language is Thai, we want to prove Thai's SpriteText is not loaded.

1. Start game with any language other than Thai.
2. In language select menu, select Thai.
3. Now current language is Thai.
4. You find those text drawn with `SpriteText::drawString` are gone.

**To Fix**  
Add following case statement to `SpriteText::OnLanguageChange` method's switch-case statement.

```
case LocalizedContentManager.LanguageCode.mod:
    SpriteText.FontFile = SpriteText.loadFont(LocalizedContentManager.CurrentModLanguage.FontFile);
    SpriteText.fontPixelZoom = LocalizedContentManager.CurrentModLanguage.FontPixelZoom;
    break;
```

Hi! Would you be interested in joining the Stardew Valley 1.6 alpha? Then you can propose the fix as part of 1.6, and test that it's working for you once it's done. You'll need to join the Stardew Valley Discord though. ‚ÄîPathoschild (talk) 18:54, 15 February 2023 (UTC)

Sure. I'm already at Discord. How do I access? My id is `Becks723#7620`. --Ëá≠ÁæéÈ¶ôÂñ∑Âñ∑ (talk) 19:07, 15 February 2023 (UTC)

You're now in the alpha channel! You can check your Discord pings to find it. ‚ÄîPathoschild (talk) 20:19, 15 February 2023 (UTC)

## Text within Wikipedia pages

Hello Pathoschild, since v1.6 is now out, I feel like the Wiki needs a clean-up, and that is that the Wiki pages use capital letters for the links, they need to be lowercased to match paragraphs in proper English, unless if it's the start of a paragraph, proper nouns, bold text at the start of a page, or the name of a villager. This will improve the language of the Wiki and make it easier to read. Please work on this Pathoschild, thank you. 9000 (talk ‚Ä¢ contributions) 10:20, 20 March 2024 (UTC)

9000, I've asked you before to stop nit-picking capitalization in a language that is not your first language. Please stop pestering other folks. margotbean (talk) 20:52, 20 March 2024 (UTC)

Hi! I wouldn't mind a discussion about capitalization, but we shouldn't make large-scale changes like that without reaching a consensus first. I mainly work on modding and technical pages though, so margotbean would be the main person to discuss general content style with. ‚ÄîPathoschild (talk) 23:09, 20 March 2024 (UTC)

Hello Pathoschild, Margotbean is saying that English is not my first language and says that my edits do not improve the Wiki, especially when **changing links**. English only uses capital letters at the start of paragraphs or proper nouns, you changed the Version History page in lowercasing links, but Margotbean didn't care about you doing it, she cares about us doing it. The Wiki is the exact opposite for the most part, it really needs to be **matching** paragraphs in proper English, she doesn't care about **adding** links, but when **changing** them. Also in her user page, it reads *If you need to contact me about Wiki issues, feel free to post.* When you do that, she doesn't give a response about what you wrote to her at all. Margotbean hates me now. Please reply to her talk page about all of this, thank you so much. 9000 (talk ‚Ä¢ contributions) 05:18, 21 March 2024 (UTC)

I prefer lowercase too, but I don't think it's as straightforward as you suggest. An argument can be made both for treating page names as regular text (like version history) or as page titles (like Version History). There's also precedent in wiki tradition, since the earliest wikis used VersionHistory (one word with capitals) to indicate page links.

I also don't think it's a question of favouritism, since Margotbean and I have definitely argued and disagreed before. There's a distinction between the content articles (which use capitalized links) and technical documentation pages (which use lowercase links). The two sections of the wiki have somewhat different audiences and style conventions (e.g. technical documentation tends to prefer named links over naked links), and Version History (or version history?) falls somewhere between the two so it can go either way.

So I'm fine discussing the capitalization conventions, but we shouldn't just change the convention used by each section without agreeing on the changes first. ‚ÄîPathoschild (talk) 06:12, 21 March 2024 (UTC)

I agree with these changes, but another thing while we're at it, the Wiki uses a **lot** of errors in links, which need to be fixed, for example: `the [[The Mines|Mines]]` looks like gibberish to me, so I change it to the following coding: `[[the Mines]]`. The capitalization of links shouldn't just be all capitals, as it makes it bad for reading, for example: `[[Cave Carrot]]s` should look like the following: `[[Cave Carrot|cave carrots]]`. This doesn't affect the targeted page or create a redlink, but titles it to lowercase letters instead of capital letters. Hopefully this will be changed to match proper English. 9000 (talk ‚Ä¢ contributions) 06:08, 22 March 2024 (UTC)

## Template changes

I have to give you 20 lashes with a wet noodle for changing Template:Version and Template:Content Patcher version in English only. *Someone* has to make the changes in all 12 languages, so if it's not you, then it falls on me. In fairness to everyone else I've been chastising and correcting, I have to do the same for you. So, can you and will you make the changes in all 12 languages? Thank you in advance for your reply üëç margotbean (talk) 18:26, 1 April 2024 (UTC)

Done! ‚ÄîPathoschild (talk) 21:06, 1 April 2024 (UTC)

## User issue

Could you please take a look at Stardew Valley Wiki:Admin noticeboard#Adding external links to Modding:Mod compatibility and see if you can help, or direct them to discord? Let me know if my assistance is required! Thanks, margotbean (talk) 18:09, 15 April 2024 (UTC)

Done! I replied there. ‚ÄîPathoschild (talk) 19:37, 15 April 2024 (UTC)

## Changes in Chinese Translation

Hello, Pathochild!

I saw that you updated the "Modding: Migration to Stardew Valley 1.6.9" page yesterday, adding a new section called "Name translation changes for wiki maintainers". However, I noticed that the section did not mention any changes regarding the Chinese translation, and I am somewhat concerned about this.

The Chinese translation underwent significant changes in 1.6.4, which sparked intense dissatisfaction among various Chinese forums. In my opinion, part of the reason for this discontent lies in the fact that the translation made substantial unnecessary alterations to content that many players were already familiar with, along with the perceived arrogance displayed by the previous translation team. Subsequently, these changes were reverted back in 1.6.6. Nevertheless, the translation modification actually corrected some long-standing errors, but they were also rolled back together. I am concerned that this matter has had a significant impact on the further improvement of Chinese translation, as it may lead to a more conservative localization of games and a reluctance to make changes. I am concerned that many translation issues may become permanent problems, so I would like to ask: Does this mean that the Chinese translation has not made any changes in 1.6.9 (i.e. no difference from 1.6.8)?

I apologize for any inconvenience caused by my inquiry, as I don't know how to contact the localization team.

I want to express my admiration for your immense contributions to the development of Stardew Valley and the editing of the wiki. Thank you for all your hard work! Á¨¨‰∫å‰∏™ÁÜ∫ (talk) 17:04, 1 September 2024 (UTC)

Hello Á¨¨‰∫å‰∏™ÁÜ∫! The upcoming Stardew Valley 1.6.9 fixes a large number of translation issues across all languages, including Chinese. The Chinese translations are mostly unchanged in 1.6.9 aside from technical bug fixes though. You could try contacting ConcernedApe if have questions about the long-term localization strategy for Chinese. ‚ÄîPathoschild (talk) 16:40, 3 September 2024 (UTC)

Thank you for telling me this! Maybe I'm overthinking it. Á¨¨‰∫å‰∏™ÁÜ∫ (talk) 18:19, 3 September 2024 (UTC)

## Mod compatibility page

Hi, Pc

I just saw that the page was moved and my first reaction was a mild heart attack, something like:

WAIT, WHAT?! &gt; WHERE IS THE LIST?! OBSOLETE?! &gt; WHY?!

Then I went to the history page and fortunately found your edit comment saying this was just a matter of technical issue with MediaWiki etc. As this page is very important to the wiki, I'd like to suggest 2 tweaks on the current banner:

1. Add a very short reason explaining the closure of the page.  
   (Even if most people don't know what a "template include limit" is, they'll be less distressed knowing that this is just a technical limitation.)
2. Explicitly say that people can access the list on on smapi.io to "read" it.  
   (Most users that used to visit that page aren't editors, they're just looking for their beloved mods.)

In the next couple of years, this page will certainly continue to be visited by many users that follow external links or have bookmarked it on their devices... So I thought a more elaborate message could help them. Sapador (talk) 02:40, 19 November 2024 (UTC)

Hi! I reworked Modding:Mod compatibility to be less confusing for players who land there; how does that look? (See its talk page for more info on why it was moved.) ‚ÄîPathoschild (talk) 04:28, 20 November 2024 (UTC)

This looks great. Thank you! Sapador (talk) 12:15, 28 November 2024 (UTC)

## Outdated Modding page (migrate to 64-bit)

Hello! The page Modding:Migrate to 64-bit on Windows is mostly outdated, and the Chinese page is even more old so I can't update it at all. Perhaps we should add a note about that. As for the Chinese page, I think we should delete it. VulpesLucida (talk) 11:55, 20 January 2025 (UTC)

Hi! That guide is completely obsolete now; I redirected it to Modding:Migrate to Stardew Valley 1.5.5 and removed the links to it. ‚ÄîPathoschild (talk) 16:18, 20 January 2025 (UTC)
