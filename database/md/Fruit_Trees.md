*For Trees that do not yield fruit, see Trees.*

**Fruit Trees** require 28 days to mature, after which they produce one fruit per day when in season. Fruit can accumulate up to three days before harvesting. Fruit trees do not need to be watered, and will not die in the winter. Fruit saplings will grow during any season, allowing players to plant and prepare for upcoming seasons to bear fruit. Tree Fertilizer cannot be used on Fruit Trees.

Each Fruit tree must be planted in the center of a clear 3x3 ground area, except that they may be placed next to a permanent structure (*i.e.,* Farmhouse). "Clear" means free of objects, flooring/paths, and terrain features, but not including grass, Seed Spots and artifact spots.\[1] The 3x3 clear planting area also must not overlap the 3x3 area of another fruit tree. The game prevents planting fruit trees too close to each other, ensuring a minimum distance of two tiles between them in every direction. Fruit tree saplings can be retrieved by cutting the tree.

While a fruit tree sapling is immature, the 3x3 area around it must remain clear in order for the sapling to grow. If overnight debris spawns too close to it, the game pops up a message the next morning saying the fruit tree could not grow that night. Objects placed next to a sapling cause the same message and growth obstruction. Once a fruit tree is mature, growth is no longer an issue, and one fruit is produced each day in season. Then objects, including flooring/paths, may be placed next to the fruit tree without hindering production.

A Fruit Tree is planted directly into untilled ground. Fruit trees can grow in the Greenhouse, in the center soil or around the border. Fruit trees planted in the greenhouse or on Ginger Island bear fruit every day after maturity, and will maintain their summer appearance regardless of season.

Fruit trees can be chopped down, yielding normal wood and a matching sapling of the same quality as the fruit. When chopped at stage 1 of growth, it will instead drop its respective sapling. High-quality saplings mature faster than normal: a silver sapling grows 2 times faster, a gold sapling grows 3 times faster, and an iridium sapling grows 5 times faster. \[2]

A complete set of all six fruit tree saplings costs a total of data-sort-value="25400"&gt;25,400g if purchased from Pierre's General Store.

## Fruit Quality &amp; Price

A tree's fruit increases in quality by one star per year of tree age after reaching maturity. Fruit trees will produce silver star fruit after one year, gold after two years, and iridium after three. Higher-quality saplings will start producing higher-quality fruit faster (for example, an iridium-quality sapling will start to produce iridium-quality fruit 73 days after planting). Once the tree is fully grown, the surrounding area does not need to be kept clear for the tree's fruit to increase in quality.\[3]

## Summer

Banana and Mango Trees will grow and produce fruit year-round on Ginger Island. In the valley, they produce fruit only in Summer.

Note that Bananas and Mangos are not considered "Fruit Tree Fruit" for gifting purposes, but instead follow the villager's preferences for "non-Fruit Tree Fruit".

## Weather

Fruit trees will not be affected by weather, *i.e.,* fruit will keep producing one per day whether it is raining, windy, or sunny.

However, during storms, fruit trees can be struck by lightning, causing them to become burnt for 4 days. During this time, they will not produce fruit, but will instead produce coal. After the 4 days are up, they will return to normal. Shown below are fruit trees after being struck by lightning.

- Apricot Tree
- Banana Tree
- Cherry Tree
- Mango Tree
- Orange Tree
- Peach Tree
- Pomegranate Tree

## Tips

Due to the increased growth rate, chopping down a fruit tree as soon as it would produce a silver sapling and replanting that sapling on the same day, will result in the tree producing iridium quality fruit more than a full season sooner than a tree planted at the same time that is not cut down and replanted.

## Bugs

It should be possible to plant a common tree seed (*i.e.,* Acorn, Mahogany Seed, Maple Seed, or Pine Cone) and a Fruit Tree sapling (in either order) two tiles away from each other. A bug prevents the player from planting a common tree seed exactly two tiles away from an existing Fruit Tree sapling and from planting a Fruit Tree sapling two tiles away from a common tree seed. The common tree seed is treated as though it were another Fruit Tree sapling.
