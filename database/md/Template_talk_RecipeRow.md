## Sorting Problem

I noticed the use of this template disallows using `data-sort-value` as a cell parameter. Hence, relevant columns cannot be sorted correctly on the Defense and Luck pages. The problem doesn't raise in other stats page since the dishes come to have less diversified buffs. But while I'm remarking the problem, I don't see an easy or neat way to circumvent it. -- Charly (talk) 03:23, 16 November 2021 (UTC)
