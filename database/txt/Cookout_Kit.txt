The Cookout Kit is a craftable item that can be used to create a small cooking fire used for Cooking outside of the player's Farmhouse. Once placed, it can be destroyed using an axe, hoe, or pickaxe. Any Cookout Kits left overnight will disappear the next day.
Two Cookout Kits are the reward for completing the Wild Medicine Bundle in the Crafts Room (Remixed). If a player has already used the Golden Joja Parrot, then Professor Snail will give one Cookout Kit as a reward for donating the Mummified Frog to the Island Field Office.
