The **Spice Berry** is a fruit found via foraging throughout Stardew Valley in the Summer. It can also be grown from Summer Seeds and can be found at any time (randomly) in the Farm Cave if the fruit bat option is chosen. Three Spice Berries can be purchased from Demetrius' shop at the Desert Festival for data-sort-value="10"&gt; 10 Calico Eggs each. It can also randomly be found in Garbage Cans during Summer.

Putting a Spice Berry in a Seed Maker will generate 1-3 Summer Seeds.
