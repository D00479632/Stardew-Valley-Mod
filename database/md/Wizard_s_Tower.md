Wizard's Tower

Open Hours: 6:00am to 11:00pm Occupants:

Wizard

The **Wizard's Tower** is the home of the Wizard. It is located at the western edge of Cindersap Forest and is open from 6am-11pm.

The door to the Wizard's Tower is locked until the day the player receives in the mail an invitation from the Wizard to visit him there. This day is the first non-holiday after the player enters the Community Center and reads the golden scroll in the Crafts Room, or else purchases a JojaMart Membership. The visit unlocks the player's ability to read the Junimo language, which in turn enables bundles to be donated to the Community Center.

## Basement Room

After reaching four hearts with the Wizard, players will gain access to a basement where they can change their name, gender, favorite thing, and the appearance they set at character creation. The Shrine of Illusions requires an offering of data-sort-value="500"&gt;500g each time it is used.

In late game, after players complete the quest Goblin Problem to gain passage to the Witch's Hut a teleportation rune will activate in the basement, allowing free passage between the basement room and the Witch's Hut anytime.

After obtaining the Far Away Stone the player can use it on the stone in the corner to obtain the Meowmere.

## Buildings

*For the traditional farm Buildings, see Farm Buildings.*

After retrieving the Wizard's Magic Ink, he'll make some unique buildings available for sale. After unlocking Ginger Island as well, the Island Obelisk will become available. These buildings require no build time, but are very expensive.

To summon buildings, interact with the magic book inside the tower. The construction menu opened by the book functions the same as that in the Carpenter's Shop, allowing the player to move, paint, or demolish farm buildings.
