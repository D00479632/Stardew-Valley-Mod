**Clothing** consists of hats, rings, footwear, trinkets, shirts, pants, shorts, and skirts that can be equipped in the player's inventory screen. They can be found, bought, and won in several ways (for example, won during festivals or found in the mines).

Hats, shirts, and pants are purely cosmetic items, unlocked from collecting certain Achievements or tailored.

Rings provide a variety of passive benefits, from providing light to increasing combat stats. Two rings can be equipped at the same time.

Footwear can increase defense, immunity, or both, and also show up on your character's model.

Trinkets provide a variety of passive benefits, from an enemy eating companion to shooting ice. The trinket slot is unlocked upon achieving Combat Mastery.

All clothings (except trinkets) can be stored in the dresser.
