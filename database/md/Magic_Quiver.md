The **Magic Quiver** is a trinket item obtainable after claiming Combat Mastery. It can be obtained by slaying monsters or breaking crates and barrels in the Mines, Skull Cavern, or Quarry Mine. Drop chances from both methods are affected by daily luck and luck buffs, among other factors. The Burglar's Ring and Monster Compendium do not impact the chance to obtain it from monsters.\[1] There is also a ≈0.6% chance to obtain a Magic Quiver from a treasure chest in the Skull Cavern.\[2]

While the Magic Quiver is equipped in the trinket slot, the player occasionally shoots a magic arrow that damages the first monster in its path. Any overlapping monsters will also be damaged. When enemies are within 7-8 tiles of the player, a magic arrow is automatically shot straight towards the nearest enemy. Magic arrows cause some knockback and pass through all environmental objects (like mining nodes or weeds).\[3]

There are four types of Magic Quivers: regular, "Perfect", "Rapid", and "Heavy". The quiver's type will determine the possible values for the time between shots (*X*), minimum damage (*Y*), and maximum damage (*Z*).

## Types

The Magic Quiver is a random type when dropped, and it can be changed to any of four possible types if re-forged on an Anvil. The generation rates listed below are the chances to obtain each particular type.\[4]

Cooldown is determined to the tenth of a second for the regular and Heavy types, and it is determined to the hundredth of a second for the Rapid type. For all types, damage is determined to the whole number. All possible values of both stats are equally likely for their specific types (*e.g.*, a "**Rapid Magic Quiver**" has a 9.09% chance to have a 0.65 second cooldown and a 20% chance to have a damage range of 9-14).\[4] These stats are also re-rolled when the trinket is re-forged on an Anvil, so it is possible to receive the same type of quiver with different stats.

Modifier Cooldown Min Damage Max Damage Generation Rate\[4] (None) 1.1 - 2.1 seconds 13 - 28 Min Damage + 5 86.4% **Perfect** 0.9 seconds 30 35 4% **Rapid** 0.6 - 0.7 seconds 8 - 12 Min Damage + 5 4.8% **Heavy** 1.5 - 2.0 seconds 23 - 38 Min Damage + 5 4.8%
