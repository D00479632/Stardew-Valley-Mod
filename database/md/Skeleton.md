## Behavior

Skeletons will approach and attack the player by collision. They also have a longer-ranged bone throw attack, which passes through rocks. This ranged attack is interrupted if the skeleton takes damage.

## Strategy

Simply hit them as soon as possible to prevent them from throwing bones. If they do throw bones, either dodge them or swing at them with a weapon, as they can be destroyed with any weapon that deals damage.

## Trivia

During the Spirit's Eve event, the player can find two caged skeletons in the middle of the town where some villagers view them.
