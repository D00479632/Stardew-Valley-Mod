Pelican Town is where the player moves to at the start of the game, located in Stardew Valley. Pelican Town is where most of the villagers live, work, and socialize.
Lewis is the mayor of Pelican Town and has been for over 20 years; he comments that he has not had competition for the role since first becoming mayor.
The northwest entrance to town connects to the Bus Stop and the Farm. The southwest passage connects to Cindersap Forest, which contains Marnie's Ranch, Leah's Cottage, and the Wizard's Tower. Directly south of town is the Beach. North of town connects to the Mountain, with Robin's Carpenter Shop, the Mines, the Adventurer's Guild, the Railroad, and the Quarry.
Initially, there are weeds located near 2 Willow Lane, in the area behind 1 Willow Lane, behind JojaMart, and to the west of the Community Center, below the playground. These weeds will die during Winter, but will respawn at the start of each new year.
When attempting to cut most trees in Pelican Town, a message will show saying "I shouldn't cut down trees in town."

Secrets
If a Super Cucumber is placed in the hidden brown box located in the fenced area north of the Blacksmith, the player will receive the secret ??HMTGF?? statue.
One Prize Ticket can be found in a hidden gift box to the northeast of the Bookseller, in a small fenced area blocked by a large stump.
The Alleyway Buffet can be obtained from a hidden golden garbage can in the easternmost region of town, by entering a concealed opening in the eastern fence just north of the Minecart track outside of the Blacksmith. The path is blocked by a large log and boulder.
Trivia
Pelican Town is located within the Ferngill Republic, at war with the Gotoro Empire across the Gem Sea.[6]
Dr. Harvey, in calling out on his shortwave radio, identifies his location (in Pelican Town) as 52 north, 43.5 east. Thus, if Stardew Valley is on Earth, it can be found near a village called Krasnoye (one of many such) in Russia - about 160 km (100 mi) WNW of Saratov, and about 600 km (375 mi) SE of Moscow. "Krasnoye" means "beautiful" or "red". However, it is not on a sea shore.
The player cannot refill their watering can from the fountain.
