The **Frozen Geode** is a Mineral deposit that contains minerals, artifacts, ores, or basic resources. It can be found on floors 41 to 79 of the Mines, on the Farm in the Winter, or inside a Fishing Treasure Chest. It can also be received as a gift at the Feast of the Winter Star. An Ice Pip Fish Pond may produce 1 or 5 Frozen Geodes when the population of the pond reaches 9. Frozen Geodes can also be obtained by pickaxing Frozen Geode Nodes. These are found in the small quarry on the Hill-top Farm and Four Corners Farm. Sebastian sells Frozen Geodes in his shop at the Desert Festival for data-sort-value="10"&gt; 10 Calico Eggs.

The Frozen Geode can be broken open by Clint in the Blacksmith shop for data-sort-value="25"&gt;25g or by using a Geode Crusher.

Neither daily luck nor luck buffs affect the contents of a Frozen Geode.

### Resources

Note that Gold Ore is available in the Frozen Geode only after the player has reached floor 76 of the Mines. Before reaching floor 76, Iron Ore is substituted when breaking open a Frozen Geode. Except for clay and stone, the following items will be obtained in the following amounts: 30% for 1, 30% for 3, 30% for 5, 9% for 10, and 1% for 20. Stone has a 50% chance to use those values and a 50% chance to give only 1. Only 1 clay can be obtained from a single geode.

## Quests

- Five Frozen Geodes may be requested by Ice Pip in a Fish Pond quest to increase the capacity of the pond from 5 to 7.
- One Frozen Geode may be requested by several ocean fish in a Fish Pond quest to increase the capacity of the pond from 3 to 5.
- Five Frozen Geodes may be requested by the Raccoon at the Giant Stump as part of his fifth request, or as part of any request starting with the sixth.

## Trivia

- By multiplying the sell price of each item by the chance to obtain it and how many you would receive on average (with ores, clay, and stone) and adding those products together, you can find the average profit of breaking open a single frozen geode. Frozen geodes have an average return of data-sort-value="101.1"&gt;101.1g\[1]. With the Gemologist Profession, frozen geodes have an average return of data-sort-value="125.74"&gt;125.74g\[1]. The frozen geode will sell in the shipping bin for data-sort-value="100"&gt;100g. It is therefore profitable to process frozen geodes through Geode Crusher or sell the contents with Gemologist.
