## Gravestones

There are 4 gravestones within the roughly 300 square tiles that are the Graveyard.

### Mona

The only gravestone with a name attributed to it, it sits in the middle of the top 3 stones. The epitaph reads:

“ “Our Beloved Mona”

Abigail can be seen sitting next to Mona's gravestone during her 6-heart event. She also stands in front of it, depending on her schedule.

### Old and Faded

The gravestone to the left of Mona's reads:

“ “It's old and faded...”

### Dwarvish Headstone

After obtaining the Dwarvish Translation Guide, the gravestone to the right of Mona's reads:

“ “You translate the dwarvish:

Stand between the pillars three

With gift as precious as the sky:

A rainbow forged from land, not sea

Then galaxies will heed your cry.”

This is referring to the three pillars in the northeast of the Calico Desert.

### Unknown

The stone that is the bottom left of the four is currently unclickable.
