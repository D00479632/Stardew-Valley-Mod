Moss is a resource obtained from moss-covered trees. Each day in Spring, Summer, and Fall, some amount of common trees can randomly grow moss after certain time. Moss grows slower on Sunny Summer days. Additionally, two types of Green Rain Trees can grow Moss. Moss growth is accelerated for these two trees, and when covered in moss and planted near common trees accelerate moss growth on the common trees. [1] The trees do not need to be felled to collect the Moss. Moss can be removed and collected with any tool, weapon, or bomb. One Tree drops 1 to 2 pieces of Moss.
Players can use Vinegar on a tree to prevent that tree from growing Moss.
Using an Axe on a tapped tree covered in Moss will remove the Tapper and the Moss in one hit, while a Pickaxe will remove only the tapper on the first hit. Using any other methods will harvest moss without collecting the tapper.
Moss becomes much more common during the Green Rain event, covering most mossy trees. This weather event also spawns exclusive weeds that have a 10% chance to drop Moss.[2] Additionally, Large Weeds spawned by the event will drop 2-3 Moss when cut.[3]
Each Moss collected gives the player 1 Foraging XP.

Moss Growth
For moss to grow on a tree, it must be a fully grown Oak Tree, Maple Tree, Pine Tree, or Green Rain Tree Type 1 or 2.[4] No other types of trees can grow moss. The tree's growth stage must also be at least 14.
At the start of each day, all eligible trees will have a chance to grow Moss. The chance for a tree to grow moss varies depending on the weather and season. The growth chance is 10% on Sunny days, which decreases to 3.3% if it is Summer. On Rainy days, the growth chance is 20%.[1]
Trees will have a 50% chance to receive a 10% boost to their moss growth chance if one of the following conditions are met:
The tree is a (non-temporary) Type 1 or Type 2 Green Rain Tree.
The tree's surrounding 5x5 grid contains a (non-temporary) Type 1 or Type 2 Green Rain Tree that has Moss on it.
During a Green Rain, all trees that are able to grow Moss will instantly grow Moss, regardless of their growth stage.
During Winter, Moss cannot grow at all (except inside the Greenhouse), and all pre-existing Moss on trees is removed.
Collecting moss from a tree reduces its growth stage to 12 - the amount of Moss it dropped.
