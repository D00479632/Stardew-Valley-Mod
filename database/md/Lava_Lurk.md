**Lava Lurks** are an enemy found in the Volcano Dungeon.

## Behavior

The Lava Lurk swims in lava, then pops its head out and shoots 4 fireballs that deal damage. A fireball can be destroyed by hitting it with a weapon. Players can hit a Lava Lurk when its head is visible, but not when it's swimming under lava. A Lava Lurk can deal direct damage if the player stands next to it.

Unlike all other enemies, loot dropped when a Lava Lurk is killed go directly into the player's inventory, regardless of the player's distance. However, if inventory is full, loot will be dropped on the ground and may fall into lava.

## Trivia

This creature is very likely to have been inspired by the Blargg from the Super Mario franchise's "Super Mario World".
