On Talk:Mushroom\_Tree talk about poking around in `Farm::DayUpdate()`. Where do you find that stuff to poke around? Zendowolf (talk) 18:59, 15 March 2021 (UTC)

^Yup, that's basically it, lol. I decompiled it and look at it in Visual Studio Code (the free version). I do not know C#, but knowing HTML and a bit of Python has provided me enough of a foundation to bumble around. Some pages have references of where to look in the game code, which can be a good place to start, but many don't. The modding pages have some great context and info too. Good luck!
