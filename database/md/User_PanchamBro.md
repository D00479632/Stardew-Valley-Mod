From Stardew Valley Wiki

Hey, it's me **PanchamBro**. I'm an artist, as well as a wiki editor, though I don't contribute here often. Coupled with the fact I haven't played *Stardew Valley* a lot lately, and it's obvious that while I still love this game for what it has done for me, I don't have the time to play with my farm as I did before.

You'll have a better shot finding me on Nookipedia or FamiWiki. Additional contact info, such as links to my Tumblr and Twitter, can be found on Carrd.
