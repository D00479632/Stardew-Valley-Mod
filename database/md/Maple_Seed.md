The **Maple Seed** is a seed that grows into a Maple Tree. It can be obtained by shaking/chopping down a Maple Tree at Foraging level 1, in Garbage Cans, or by using an Axe or Pickaxe to dig up a Maple Seed dropped by a fully grown Maple Tree on The Farm. One to five Maple Seeds may be produced in a Woodskip Fish Pond when the population reaches 9.

Maple Seeds can be planted in tillable ground outside The Farm. The ground must be un-tilled to plant the seed.

A maple seed has approximately a 20% chance to grow to the next stage each night during Spring, Summer, or Fall. There are 5 growth stages in total. The median time to maturity is about 18 days, with over 90% of seeds maturing in less than 32 growing days.

The use of Tree Fertilizer guarantees growth by one stage each night, including during Winter.
