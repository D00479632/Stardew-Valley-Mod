The **Ice Pip** is a fish that can be caught in the Mines on the 60th floor during all seasons. The only other fish that can be caught there is the Ghostfish.

The chances of hooking an Ice Pip depends on fishing level and on the fishing zone of the spot fished, increasing by 4.5% if a Curiosity Lure is equipped and by 9% if Ice Pip Bait is equipped. For example, at level 10 fishing and fishing zone of 5, the chances of hooking an Ice Pip is 6.45%. This increases to 10.95% with a Curiosity Lure equipped, to 15.45% with Ice Pip Bait equipped, and to 19.95% with both a Curiosity Lure and Ice Pip Bait equipped.\[1]

## Tailoring

The Ice Pip can be used in the spool of the Sewing Machine to create the Fishing Hat. It can be used in dyeing, serving as a blue dye at the dye pots, located in Emily's and Haley's house, 2 Willow Lane.

## Fish Pond

Ice Pips can be placed in a Fish Pond, where they will reproduce every 5 days. The initial pond capacity is 1 fish, but the capacity can be increased to 10 by completing four quests. The primary output is blue Ice Pip Roe, but Iron Ore is possible at population 3 and several more valuable items are possible starting at population 9.
