The Big Chest is a storage item that holds up to 70 different types of items, which is nearly double that of the regular chest which holds 36 different items. Using it on a regular chest or stone chest replaces it, keeping the contents inside and dropping the old chest.
Coloring
When opened, chests have a color bar above their inventory window which allows players to select a different color for the chest, the same as the smaller variant. This can be changed at anytime without cost. There are 20 colors available to select in the color picker, plus the original brown color.
