Giant Stump

Address: Cindersap Forest, west of Marnie's Ranch Occupants: Raccoon family

The **Giant Stump** is located in the northern area of Cindersap Forest to the west of Marnie's Ranch.

It begins as a huge tree with no notable attributes. It becomes the Giant Stump after a strong wind storm fells the tree. Interacting with the stump starts "The Giant Stump" quest. Later, it becomes the home to a raccoon, who populates it with his wife and their children over the course of his request questline.

## Questline

**Note:** After "The Giant Stump" quest, the rest isn't a true "quest" as it is not one of the journaled quests but rather a series of interactable requests, similar to those requests given by the Trash Bear.

### Pre-habitation

After the strong wind storm random event occurs, the resulting stump has a "?" dialog which may be interacted with to start "The Giant Stump" quest, where the player must repair the stump with 100 Hardwood.

### Raccoon's Requests

The day after the stump is repaired, a raccoon moves in. Following this, he has a series of requests for items, each yielding rewards. The requested items often require the use of various Artisan Equipment, such as the Dehydrator, Fish Smoker, and Preserves Jar.

After completing a request, a new request will be made after 7 days, which is indicated by the appearance of his wife (and later on, children). Completing 9 requests will earn the player the Good Neighbors Achievement. The player can continue to complete additional requests for more rewards. The items requested will usually be related to and obtainable in the current season. If a request is generated in the last week (Days 22-28) of any season, then the Raccoon will ask for items related to the following season (*e.g.*, a request made on Spring 24 will ask for Summer items).\[1]
