Well, Abigail (my spouse ;)) says something like "But I wanted to dance with... I'm only joking, I love you [Player]!" Botautal (talk) 19:01, 4 April 2021
Not important.
Is there a way to get the flower dance crown or dress/suit? I feel like I always stand out. S0ymiLk, Stardew Valley supernerd (talk) 22:01, 14 October 2022 (UTC)
You would need a mod for that. I'm not aware of one, but I'm not aware of most mods, to be honest. You can search Modding:Mod compatibility, or ask on Discord. Best of luck! margotbean (talk) 04:23, 15 October 2022 (UTC)
Accepted Offer dialogues
Since every Villager page has the dialogue where they refuse your Offer, we are missing the Accepted Offer dialogues, as this is making us feel that the wiki is incomplete because every Villager have all the dialogue they give, but we're missing the Accepted Offer dialogues. We should get some people to do that offer. 9000 (talk) 9:29, 29 April 2023 (UTC)
Trivia about Haley
She seems to be following certain walking and facing pattern as her "dancing practice", rather than "wandering aimlessly" as stated in the Trivia part. Cigarmemr (talk) 15:40, 2 December 2024 (UTC)
