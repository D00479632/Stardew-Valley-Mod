For the stone chest color images, should we get it from the color picker images or the placed images? Blushock (talk) 23:53, 2 February 2023 (UTC)
I don't honestly think we need them at all. margotbean (talk) 03:14, 3 February 2023 (UTC)
Maybe not, but how come we have the colored images for the wooden chest? Blushock (talk) 17:05, 3 February 2023 (UTC)
The honest answer is that someone else uploaded them, and I didn't see a strong enough reason to remove them. margotbean (talk) 19:06, 3 February 2023 (UTC)
