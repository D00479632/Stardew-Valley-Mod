Villagers are characters in Stardew Valley. They are citizens who live in and around Pelican Town. Each villager has a daily routine, so they can be located in different sections of town depending on the in-game time of the day and weather.
Villagers provide quests and can be given gifts to increase affection. Each villager has unique likes and dislikes, and will respond to gifts differently.
For villager gift preferences, see the following pages:
