From Stardew Valley Wiki

I decided to create this page so my name would stop showing up in red when I edited pages on the wiki.

I hope to release some mods for Stardew Valley soon. Sometimes when I'm in the decompiled source code for the game I notice things that I think are cool. I like to add those to the wiki.

See for instance these things that I thought were neat:

Some information I found about what the curiosity lure actually does.

Some information I found about an unused skill points system still in the game's code.

Some information I found about an unused dialogue and a cutscene related to the bus stop.
