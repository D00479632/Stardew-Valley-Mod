The **Warrior Ring** is a ring that can be crafted after earning the recipe at Combat Level 4. The ingredients are: 10 Iron Bars, 25 Coal, and 10 Frozen Tears.

The Warrior Ring has a chance of giving the Warrior Energy buff after slaying a Monster. This buff increases Attack by 10 for 5 seconds, and can stack with other Attack buffs from food or other Attack boosting rings.

The chance of receiving the buff is increased by Luck buffs from food or Lucky Rings, but not daily Luck. It is calculated\[1] as `0.1 + (Luck Level / 100)` meaning each additional level of Luck buff increases the odds by 1%: +1 Luck increases the base chance from 10% to 11%, +2 Luck increases it to 12%, and so on.

If two Warrior Rings are equipped, the chance is rolled twice. If either one succeeds, the buff is applied.\[2]

## Dyeing
