Secret notes
There are a few "useless" secret notes, such as the one with a picture of Marnie and Jas. Correct me if I'm wrong, but all the other secret notes are useful. KittyKaia (talk) 20:10, 27 March 2022 (UTC)
The significance of the picture of a young Marnie & Jas remains a mystery. I haven't asked ConcernedApe about it myself, but I doubt he'd give a straightforward answer. The rest of the notes are more or less useful, depending on whether or not you already knew the info. contained in them. margotbean (talk) 21:20, 27 March 2022 (UTC)

Should we put a {{spoiler}} template on this page?--Shirotsuki (talk) 12:03, 1 April 2024 (UTC)
Hello Shirotsuki! Nice to see you back on the wiki! You can add a spoiler alert if you want to. With the size of v1.6, almost every page would need one, so I'm not too bothered by the lack of one, but it's up to you. margotbean (talk) 18:16, 1 April 2024 (UTC)
I went and put the Spoiler template right before Secret Note #26 (rather than at the top of the page), because only that part contains the new 1.6 content. User314159 (talk) 19:18, 1 April 2024 (UTC)
On this note, should I put one for secret note #23? It mentions the Bearâ€™s Knowledge appearing in the Special Items and Powers tab (a change I made- should I revert this?) (first time editing the wiki) User0987 (talk) 17:44, 2 April 2024 (UTC)
Secret Note #13
Hi,
According to the wiki, if you check the bush above the playground exactl at midnight on the last day of a season, you should get a junimo plushie. There's also a screenshot on the wiki page that shows you the bush. I had multiple saves before and did this multiple times, however for the first time ever I did not get a reward. Not sure what was the reason for it, but here's some details that might help you reproduce the "issue" if you want, and maybe learn that there are some conditions that prevent you from actually getting this. (I'm just speculating tho) For the first time ever I was going the Joja path and not the bundles. Completed the whole Joja mart, got the warehouse on year one. Now I'm on year 2 end of summer and the bush looks completely different too. Not the regular berry-bush. The museum is completed, gonna get married to abigail in 2 days (she already received the pendant yesterday) and to be honest not sure if there's any other factors that can have an effect on this. My guess is the joja warehouse, as that would make sense that junimos don't like me, so why would I get a junimo related item? :D
I have two uploaded screenshots (one of the bush, and another with both the bush and the note), let me know if I can share them somehow. --Unsigned comment by Mr. Pibortot 07:32, 20 May 2024
Try accessing the bush at 12 o'clock noon instead of midnight. margotbean (talk) 21:37, 20 May 2024 (UTC)
