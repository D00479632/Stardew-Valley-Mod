“ “You can learn to survive in the wild. I have. I think we all have a hidden urge to return to nature. It's just a little scary to make the leap.” — Linus

**Linus** is a villager who lives in a small tent west of the Mines, on the Mountains north of Pelican Town.

## Relationships

Linus generally considers himself an outcast of the town who feels unwelcome and misunderstood, but wishes to be accepted. He does not trust strangers or seem to socialize with many villagers. He tells the Player of incidents in which his tent was vandalized or destroyed. During festivals, he is usually alone and away from the main festivities.

Linus and the Wizard stand next to each other at the Spirit's Eve festival.

Robin mentions that she does not mind Linus living behind their house as long as he does not bother them.

In Winter, Penny asks the player if they know Linus and expresses sympathy for him because "everyone ignores him". Emily expresses sympathy for Linus on Tuesdays in Summer, saying, "I wish everyone could learn to be accepting of others."

During Leo's six heart event, Linus, Willy, and the Player succeed in inviting Leo to live on the mainland, where he becomes neighbors with Linus. Linus and Leo bond over their love of nature, with Linus teaching him everything he knows and Leo occasionally referring to him as "Uncle Linus". They stand together at the Feast of the Winter Star.

## Quotes

“ “...Hmm? Do you want something from me?”

“ “Please don't destroy my tent. It's happened before.”

“ “I'm happy by myself, you know. I don't need new friends.”

“ “I have to be wary of strangers. Most people don't like a 'wild man'.”

“ “Someone was throwing rocks at my tent last night... I just had to wait it out.”

“ “I don't like to stay in one place for too long. There's just too much to experience in the world.”

“ “It would be nice if the townspeople could accept me for who I am. I like living out here in the open air. That's what they don't understand.”

“ “You can learn to survive in the wild. I have. I think we all have a hidden urge to return to nature. It's just a little scary to make the leap.”

“ “The people here seem nice, but they avoid me. People are afraid of the unknown.”

“ “You can learn a lot from trees. Spend time with them and they might tell you their secrets. Go in peace, young one.”

“ “During all these years I've discovered a few secrets about life. You'll have to find out for yourself.”

“ “How have you been, my young friend?”

“ “I have my own reasons for living alone like this. Some things are best left unsaid... I should do some foraging.”

“ “Whenever you catch a fish, take a moment to thank it for its sacrifice. Even if you don't believe in the spirit of the fish, it's a good mental exercise. We need to be aware of our effect on the environment”

## Quests

- "Blackberry Basket": Linus sends the player a letter on Fall 8 that says he lost his blackberry basket. The reward for returning it to him is one heart of friendship (250 friendship points).
- Linus may randomly request an item at the "Help Wanted" board outside Pierre's General Store. The reward is 3x the item's base value and 150 Friendship points.
- "Community Cleanup": On the Special Orders board in front of the Mayor's Manor, Linus may randomly request that the player collect 20 trash items and place them in the bin at the train platform. The reward is data-sort-value="500"&gt;500g, 250 friendship points, and the Fiber Seeds recipe.

## Trivia

- If the player speaks to Linus, he occasionally mentions he has ventured deep into the Mines.
- The campfire in front of Linus' tent can be toggled on or off by the player. This seems to have no impact on the game, such as special dialogues or an effect on friendship. Linus does not re-light or put out the fire.
- Linus is one of the villagers who may find the player if they pass out at 2:00am.
- If he catches the player rummaging in a Garbage Can, Linus' friendship with the player increases by 5 points, unlike when the player is caught by other villagers, whose friendship decreases by 25 points.
  
  - Prior to v1.6, this was only possible on Winter 15 while Linus was on his way to or from the Night Market, as those were the only times he was close enough to a garbage can for this interaction to occur.
  - It is also possible on Spring 16, when he stands by a trash can at the Desert Festival.
- If Linus sends the player a Catfish as a gift in the mail, he will say the mountain lake has been kind to him. However, Catfish cannot be caught in the mountain lake.
- While Linus and the Wizard are unreachable by the player at the Spirit's Eve festival, they both have dialogue in the game's data files. In Linus', he calls the Wizard an "old friend."
- If the Treasure Chest is gifted to Linus, he will not accept the gift and will give it back to the player.
