Gunther
The Museum can be found in the South-East corner of Pelican Town, south of the Blacksmith.
The museum contains a library and a gallery for displaying the museum's collection. At the start of the game, the entire museum collection is empty. Gunther, the curator, will ask the Player to help by donating Artifacts and Minerals.
Only a single copy of any particular item may be donated. Note that if an item has not yet been donated, its description in inventory or storage says: "Gunther can tell you more about this if you donate it to the museum." Items can be rearranged in the donation interface, or by clicking the small paper on the left side of Gunther's desk at any time. Donated items may be examined by right-clicking on them.
Penny tutors Vincent and Jas in the library on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday.

Notes
There is a total of 102 spaces available for donations to be placed but a total of only 95 available items to be donated. Six spaces in the center of the largest table cannot be reached to examine items placed on them, so it may be advisable to leave this area empty.
If using a controller, any diagonal item may be unreachable for examination once donated.
To move items inside the donation interface on Switch, go to "Options" and disable "Use Controller Style Menus".
In iOS (and possibly other mobile versions) items on the bottom most row cannot be moved in the donation interface. However, if the character goes to the front desk one tile to the left of Gunther, they get the option to rearrange the collection (even without completing the collection). In this mode, all the items are moveable.
