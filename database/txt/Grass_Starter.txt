Fiber (10)

Grass Starter can be planted in a tile on the Farm to create a full-grown patch of Grass instantly. Over time, a patch of grass grows and spreads to surrounding tiles in spring through fall. In winter, it goes dormant until the next spring. Grass can be harvested with the Scythe to produce Hay, once a Silo is built. Harvesting grass in winter is less productive than in the other seasons.

Tips
Fences, Lightning Rods, and most decoration items can be placed on top of a grass starter after it is planted. This will prevent animals from eating the grass starter, and let the grass expand continuously without the grass ever being entirely consumed by farm animals.
Grass Starter is meant to be used outside where farm animals can eat it, but it can be placed inside a Farm Building, or anywhere outside The Farm. Animals will not eat it, and it will not grow/spread, but it can be harvested to create Hay.
Marnie sells Grass Starters at the Desert Festival for 2 Calico Eggs each.
Bugs
Any grass patches on the Farm on Winter 28 will multiply up to 40x each on Spring 1, unless you exit the game.
