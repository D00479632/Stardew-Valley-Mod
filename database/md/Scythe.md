Scythe

It can cut grass into hay, if you've built a silo. Information Source: Starter tool Damage: 1-3 Critical Strike Chance: .02 Adventurer's Guild Purchase Price: N/A Sell Price: N/A

The **Scythe** is a tool used to cut grass, weeds, young trees, and moss. It is also required for harvesting certain crops (*i.e.,* Amaranth, Kale, Wheat). One Scythe is included in every player's inventory at the start of the game. Similar to using a Sword, equipping and using the Scythe will quickly swing it in a small radius in front of the player without consuming any energy.

If the player has a Silo, cutting each plot of Grass growing on the Farm has a 50% chance of adding one piece of Hay to the silo, or two pieces of Hay if cutting down Blue Grass.

A Scythe may be used as a weapon to inflict a small amount of damage against monsters.

The Scythe cannot be upgraded at the Blacksmith, but better scythes may be found. The Golden Scythe, a more powerful scythe, is found in the Quarry Mine, accessible after the Quarry is unlocked. The most powerful scythe, the Iridium Scythe, is received once the Player has obtained Farming Mastery.
