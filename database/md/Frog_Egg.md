The **Frog Egg** is a trinket item obtainable after claiming Combat Mastery. It can be obtained by slaying monsters or breaking crates and barrels in the Mines, Skull Cavern, or Quarry Mine. Drop chances from both methods are affected by daily luck and luck buffs, among other factors. The Burglar's Ring and Monster Compendium do not impact the chance to obtain it from monsters.\[1] There is also a ≈0.6% chance to obtain a Frog Egg from a treasure chest in the Skull Cavern.\[2]

Equipping the Frog Egg in the trinket slot causes a frog to spawn and follow the player around. When monsters are within 4-5 tiles of the frog, it will try to consume the nearest enemy by grabbing the enemy with its tongue. If unsuccessful, the frog will try again after 2 seconds. If successful, then the frog will follow the player with a full belly. After 12 seconds, the frog returns to normal size and is able to eat another enemy.\[3]

**Note:** Enemies eaten by the frog will not drop anything and do not count as kills towards quests or Monster Eradication Goals.

The frog will consume most monsters, including ones that are usually invulnerable (*e.g.*, Armored Bugs) or require specific killing methods (*e.g.*, Mummies). However, there are a few enemies that the frog will not try to eat:\[3]

- Any Slimes in a Slime Hutch
- Truffle Crabs
- Prismatic Slimes
- The secret enemy in the basement of the Mayor's Manor
