The **Dinosaur Egg** is an artifact and an animal product.

Initially, a Dinosaur Egg can be found by digging up an Artifact Spot in The Mountains (including the Quarry), in Fishing Treasure Chests after reaching Fishing level 2 and having previously found at least one artifact, dropped from a Pepper Rex, foraged on Prehistoric Floors in the Skull Cavern, or won in the Crane Game in the Movie Theater. Dinosaur Egg can also be gifted by a pet dog with max friendship.

Dinosaur Eggs can be put into an incubator in a Big or Deluxe Coop to hatch a Dinosaur ≈11 days later (≈6 days with the Coopmaster Profession). Mature and fed dinosaurs will produce Dinosaur Eggs every 7 days.
