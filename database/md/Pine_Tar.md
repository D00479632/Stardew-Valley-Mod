**Pine Tar** is a Tree sap made from a Tapper placed on a Pine Tree. The process takes 5 days, or 2 days with the Heavy Tapper.

Pine Tar can be obtained by tapping Pine Trees grown by the player or growing naturally in Stardew Valley (*e.g.,* in Cindersap Forest, the Railroad, around the Carpenter's Shop). It can also rarely be obtained after processing Hardwood in a Wood Chipper.

Although Pine Tar is labeled "Artisan Good" in-game, it does not benefit from the Artisan Profession, but instead from the Tapper Profession (+25% value).
