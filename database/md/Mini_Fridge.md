The **Mini-Fridge** allows players to expand their Refrigerator storage used for cooking. It's sold at the Carpenter's Shop for data-sort-value="3000"&gt;3,000g after upgrading the farmhouse or received in the mail after completing "Gus' Famous Omelet" Special Order.

Similar to how a regular Refrigerator works inside the Farmhouse, adding cooking ingredients to the Mini-Fridge allows players to cook food using any stored ingredients as if they were stored in inventory. There are 36 inventory slots inside.

The Mini-Fridge can be placed only inside the farmhouse, not including the cellar. It cannot be placed if obtained before the upgraded farmhouse. The Mini-Fridge can also be placed in the farmhouse on Ginger Island.
