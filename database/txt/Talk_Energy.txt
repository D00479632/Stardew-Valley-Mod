Restoration
I'm slightly confused about sleeping energy restoration. On Day Cycle page it says the player awakens with about 50% if they sleep right before 2am, while on Energy it says After retiring exhausted at 1:50AM, the player awakens with 12.5% of maximum energy. So how exactly does the 50% reduction for exhaustion work? --IBugOne (talk) 12:57, 21 March 2021 (UTC)
You will awake with 50% when passing out at 2 am or going to sleep before/at 0 am and being exhausted. List of % Energie at:
0 am=100%
0:10 am=97.5%
0:20 am=95%
0:30 am=92.5%
0:40 am=90%
0:50 am=87.5%
1 am=75%
1:10 am=72.5%
1:20 am=70%
1:30 am=67.5%
1:40 am=65%
1:50 am=62.5
2 am=50%
Every 10 minutes aftere 0 am you will lose 2.5% Energie the next morning. But at 0:50 and 1:50 am to 1:00 and 2:00 am you will lose 12.5%. Does this answer your question? Botautal (talk) 23:52, 4 April 2021 (UTC)
Energy Restoration
I was curious on what the restoration rates for the spa and multiplayer bed were, so I dug through the decompiled source code. I found the related code and discovered the rates.
I was considering adding a "Restoration" header right after "Leveling Up" that would have the information on the spa and multiplayer beds. The related source code could go under it too in collapsible fields. QtheConqueror (talk) 15:28, 2 April 2021
You can make the section, but the code doesn't need to be placed on the page, you can use reference format to state the name of the class/method where the calculations can be found. One example is on the Fishing page, I'm sorry it's not the most simple example, but it does show the syntax. All you have to do is say "See class::method in the game code" in the reference.

When you forget that you were gonna add a section for almost a year lol QtheConqueror (talk) 07:51, 21 February 2022 (UTC)
Exhaustion removal glitch?
So I was in a mad dash to get a hold quality sturgeon on the day of the luau to get the best result (i forgot to prepare ahead) and after the event i was watering my crops with low energy. I had the exhaustion debuff right as i was about to water my last two plants. Right as i was pouring the last bit of water (was gonna pass out) My character froze and passed out because the time hit 2:00. The next day i woke up with my energy bar completely full and i was confused. Wonder if anyone else can replicate this glitch? TheDude (talk) 08:18, 30 October 2022 (UTC)
Update: I tried to recreate it, and when i woke up the next day i had exactly 1 energy TheDude (talk) 09:19, 30 October 2022 (UTC)
Did you bump up a skill level in Fishing the first time? That would remove exhaustion. Giles (talk) 06:40, 21 March 2024 (UTC)
1.6
I've noticed that, on my new 1.6 farm, I'm regenerating to 100% despite going to bed at 1:50 AM pretty regularly. It seems that the late-to-bed penalty has been changed or removed in some way. I haven't tested things well enough to actually update the page, but I wanted to at least mention the change in the talk page, in case someone else wants to test or dive into the code sooner than I'll get around to doing it.

I've came here with same thing, happened at least twice - first time after Skull Cavern ride, but I thought that maybe as I used many bombs and was healing by eating I haven't noticed that I was at full energy, but right now I'm after Flower Dance event, which I finished with half energy and next day I had almost full energy, so there's something going on with it...

So, you used half your energy outside the Flower Dance, because you did not run down at the Dance. Did you bump up a skill level in something? That always refreshes full energy next day regardless of sleep time or events. Giles (talk) 17:27, 24 April 2024 (UTC)
