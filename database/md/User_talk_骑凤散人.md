## Unacceptable content

I can see that you were upset, and I appreciate that. However, your comments from today toward myself and another editor where completely inappropriate and unacceptable. Insults and masking swear words with x's are grounds for banning. Any further such comments will, unfortunately, result in an immediate ban.

In addition, you violated the rules posted on every talk page: "Be polite" and "Don't delete discussions". I would appreciate it if you would undo your deletions on the many talk pages that you found so annoying, so I don't have to do it.

In the future, you may find it helpful to walk away and take a breath before committing your thoughts to the wiki in print. I find this to be a very helpful technique when I am annoyed. Thank you, margotbean (talk) 01:49, 9 October 2024 (UTC)

It\`s not about right or wrong, It\`s about you really care about SV wiki or not. If I can stop stupid people, breaking rules and be blocked are both acceptable for me.

I really dont want to be a bad guy. The truth is you are too lenient with the bad guys and too strict with the good guys. That\`s why editors all gone. The easiest way to stop him is blocking him right now ,and you choice is blaming me here?

You are SV wiki admin, that means there is no opitions called walk away or take a breath for you, you have to face all problems and solve them.If you make thousand rules but can\`t stop a stupid troublemaker, you have totally failed here.

No need to block me, I won\`t come back again. It\`s wasting time here.骑凤散人 (talk) 02:27, 9 October 2024 (UTC)

YES! 骑凤散人 is right. You should ban the messes creator, instead stop 骑凤散人 to edit wiki. Because I am a SV fan, and try my best to make wiki better. I will support 骑凤散人 as the new administrator over you margotbean! Candybear (talk) 15:15, 11 October 2024 (UTC)
