## Thanks and a request

Hello Wikonimo! I want to thank you for all the work you do on the wiki! You've contributed a huge amount of info, and I'm extremely grateful!

I also wanted to ask if you have code references for all the rings' double stacking effects? It would be good if those were on the page (especially since no one has been able to find it since v1.5 released) ðŸ˜…

Thank you again, your efforts have helped the entire Stardew community, and I really appreciate it! margotbean (talk) 21:40, 27 July 2024 (UTC)

I enjoy contributing, it's good to know it's appreciated.

I do have references for everything I added (haven't looked at glow rings in the code yet) and I'll get to work on adding them to the pages. Wikonimo (talk) 15:40, 29 July 2024 (UTC)

## That\`s perfect page

Hello Sir Wikonimo!I see the page you create,I must say that\`s my dreaming flooring page!Really thank you for your hard working!

A small advice:2\*2 hard to tell which is flooring 02,how about make columns 3?Well,just a small advice!Depend on you.éª‘å‡¤æ•£äºº (talk) 18:47, 24 August 2024 (UTC)

Do you mean like this?

Icon Floor View Other Sources Icon Floor View Other Sources Icon Floor View Other Sources Retro Catalogue Retro Catalogue Junimo Catalogue

I agree that it's nicer to read, but on my screen it's too wide - it overflows the edge of the page and makes a horizontal scroll bar appear. I don't think there's any way around that, we don't want the images to be any smaller or to wrap the catalogue names onto two lines. Wikonimo (talk) 20:58, 25 August 2024 (UTC)

You are right,I also notice that 3 columns make sentences too crowded.Just ignore my advice sir!éª‘å‡¤æ•£äºº (talk) 21:35, 25 August 2024 (UTC)

What about adding spaces between the columns?

I would strongly prefer that to two loooooong columns. When you limit the width of the cell that holds the info about the Cursed Mannequin flooring, I think the table will be too narrow, actually... margotbean (talk) 10:56, 26 August 2024 (UTC)

Hi Wikonimo! The "Other Sources" column is too wide, and there's too many blank cells. I wouldn't have thought "Joja Furniture Catalogue" would be so wide, but there it is. Let's keep trying for something better! margotbean (talk) 04:00, 27 August 2024 (UTC)

Thoughts on the current layout? I think I'm pretty much done with everything else on the page. Wikonimo (talk) 21:13, 1 September 2024 (UTC)

It looks fantastic! **Fantastic**! And thank you for researching the sources, uploading the new images, and getting it all perfect, nice, and neat. Great job! margotbean (talk) 04:51, 2 September 2024 (UTC)

I would say thank you again, sir Wikonimo. You reaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaally solve a big problem.Chinese wiki update completed.éª‘å‡¤æ•£äºº (talk) 05:38, 3 September 2024 (UTC)

## Seed Maker probabilities

Thanks for the explanation in the revert log, I was too late to revert my own second edit; I came to the same conclusion on my own, and realized I was wrong, but you had already reverted my edit.

I suppose it would be worth explaining in the article how the numbers were computed, however, as the probability of an independent series of events (assuming a proper PRNG) isn't readily obvious to anyone who isn't a statistician (I for one, needed a refresher).

Mr Qi (talk) 09:16, 30 August 2024 (UTC)

Hi! I'm glad to hear you reached the same conclusion.

The vast majority of readers just want the info and don't care about how it was calculated, and bloating up the page with an explanation of conditional probabilities gets in their way. The talk page would be a much better place for such an explanation, as it should be the first place people go to if they look at the code themselves and reach a different conclusion. Wikonimo (talk) 09:06, 31 August 2024 (UTC)

Yes, you are absolutely correct; however, I wasn't able to create a discussion page, on the grounds of "mass edits from new user". I'll try again now. Edit: Still unable to create it. Mr Qi (talk) 00:47, 3 September 2024 (UTC)

I've copied the page from the abuse filter log. In the future, you should read Help:Editing#New Editor Restriction for what to do in this situation. (Just make smaller edits and save in-between.) Thank you both! margotbean (talk) 02:40, 3 September 2024 (UTC)
