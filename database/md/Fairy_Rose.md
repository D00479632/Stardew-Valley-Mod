The **Fairy Rose** is a flower that can be grown from Fairy Seeds in 12 days.

If grown within proper range of a Bee House (5 squares in any cardinal direction), a Fairy Rose will cause Fairy Rose Honey to be produced, increasing the honey base value from data-sort-value="100"&gt;100g to data-sort-value="680"&gt;680g. This is the most valuable type of honey, compensating for the poor profit margins on the flower itself.

Fairy Roses can be purchased from the Traveling Cart for data-sort-value="290"870–1,450g.
