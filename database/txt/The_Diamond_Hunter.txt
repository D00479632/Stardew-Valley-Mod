The Diamond Hunter is a power book that can be traded from the Volcano Dwarf in the Volcano Dungeon for 10 Diamonds.
The first reading grants the player a power that makes all stones have a 0.66% chance to drop a diamond when mined with a pickaxe, with a 50% chance to drop double if the player has the Geologist profession.[1] These drops are not affected by Mining Mastery. Once read, it can be found in the Player's menu on the Special Items & Powers tab. Each subsequent reading gives the player 100 Mining XP.
