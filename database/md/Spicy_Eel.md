**Spicy Eel** is a cooked dish. It is prepared using either the kitchen inside an upgraded farmhouse or a Cookout Kit.

**Note:** This recipe is profitable - it will result in profit when using the lowest quality ingredients.

Spicy Eel can be traded from the Desert Trader for 1 Ruby each. It may also randomly appear in Krobus' shop on Saturdays, in the Garbage Can outside the saloon, or in the Stardrop Saloon's rotating stock. The Bookseller may trade 3 Spicy Eel for 1 Treasure Appraisal Guide, provided the player has already obtained the power from that book. Up to 5 Spicy Eel may be sold by the Calico Egg Merchant in the Desert Festival for data-sort-value="10"&gt; 10 Calico Eggs each.

Spicy Eel can also be dropped by Serpents in the Skull Cavern (6% chance). A Lava Eel Fish Pond may produce 5 Spicy Eel when the population of the pond is at least 9 (3-4% chance). One Spicy Eel may be received from opening a Mystery Box. Five Spicy Eel can be obtained as a prize from the Prize Machine.
