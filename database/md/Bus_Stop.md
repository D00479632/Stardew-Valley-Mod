Bus Stop

Open Hours: 10:00 am - 5:00 pm Address: Bus Stop Occupants: None

The **Bus Stop** is an exterior map near the center of Stardew Valley, and is where you first arrive at the start of the game. The main path through this area connects the Farm to the west with Pelican Town to the east. By following the road to the west you can also access the lower section of the Backwoods (the road cannot be followed to the east).

The Minecart in the northwest corner of the map is initially broken; once repaired, it provides access to the Mines, Pelican Town near the Blacksmith, and the Quarry.

## The Bus

The bus is broken down after you arrive and remains so until repaired by the Junimos after purchasing all of the Vault Bundles for a total of data-sort-value="42500"&gt;42,500g or by purchasing the Bus repair for data-sort-value="40000"&gt;40,000g from the Joja Community Development Form.

Pam becomes the Bus Driver once the bus is repaired. She arrives at the Bus Stop at 10:10am and will leave at 5:00pm every day, and tickets are available to purchase for data-sort-value="500"&gt;500g during this time. Purchasing a ticket at the machine triggers the bus to take the Player to the Calico Desert. Tickets include the return trip from the Desert to the Bus Stop.

It is possible to get the bus earlier than 10am by waiting for Pam outside her trailer at 8:30am and standing in her way. Once she walks through the Player, she will walk significantly faster than usual and reach the bus stop at 9:30am, and a ticket can be purchased as soon as she arrives.

If Pam is unavailable for the day, she leaves a Text Sign in front of the bus telling the player why she is out and that they can drive the bus themself. This allows the player to drive to the Calico Desert on Spring 25, when Pam usually has an appointment at Harvey's Clinic, or when she is on vacation at the Ginger Island Resort. The player still has to pay data-sort-value="500"&gt;500g to use the bus.

If you leave your horse by the bus stop, when you return from the Desert a message will appear on-screen saying "Your loyal horse waits patiently for your return." or "\[Horse's name] is wondering where you have been."

## Foraging

Locations at the Bus Stop where forageable items can spawn.

Forageable items found on the ground at the Bus Stop are:\[1]

- In Spring: Daffodil (45%), Dandelion (35%), and Leek (20%)
- In Summer: Sweet Pea (47%), Spice Berry (27%), and Grape (27%)
- In Fall: Wild Plum (60%), and Hazelnut (40%)
- In Winter: Crocus (42%), Holly (35%), and Crystal Fruit (23%)

Forageable items spawn at an average rate of 1.0 per night in spring; in summer, fall, and winter the rate is 0.8 per night.\[2] The map shows the possible locations as red and magenta tiles; when the original trees are present, the magenta tiles have a 90% smaller chance of spawning items because they are identified as being behind the original trees.

## Gallery

The bus ticket shown below was never implemented in the released version of the game. It was intended to appear in the Player's wallet. In v1.3, the bus ticket image was replaced in game files with the Magnifying Glass image.

## Trivia

- After repairing the bus, Lewis will say "...did you hear? It seems the old town bus started working again overnight! That old thing has been dormant for decades... This is truly a great mystery."
- If the player warps to the Desert then takes the bus back, the player will drive the bus (even if Pam is still at the Bus Stop).
- Prior to v1.3, the bus door when getting repaired in the cutscene had a black line in the door, the door sprite was removed in v1.3.
