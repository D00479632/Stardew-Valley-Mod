Egg (1)
Fried Egg is a cooked dish. It is prepared using either the kitchen inside an upgraded farmhouse or a Cookout Kit. It is the only recipe known to the player upon creating a new save file.
Fried Egg may randomly appear in Krobus' shop on Saturdays, in the Garbage Can outside the saloon, or in the Stardrop Saloon's rotating stock. It is also sold by Alex at the Desert Festival for 10 Calico Eggs. One Fried Egg may be received from opening a Mystery Box.
