The chance of finding Radioactive Nodes in either location increases as one goes deeper into the mine, and also with daily luck and luck buffs. It is most strongly affected by Daily Luck, and only slightly affected by depth in the mine and Luck Buffs.[1]
Smelting
Radioactive Ore can be smelted in a Furnace to create a Radioactive Bar. The smelting requires 5 Radioactive Ore and 1 Coal and takes 9 hours and 20 minutes in-game time.
