Crit. Chance (short for Critical Chance) is a Combat statistic. When performing an attack, this stat will determine the likelihood to perform a stronger attack with increased damage.
A special sound plays when hitting a critical strike, and the damage numbers that pop up show the greater damage amount. Bonus damage done by critical strikes is equal to base damage × (3 + Crit. Power / 50).
The crit chance tooltip is not in any way added to the chance to crit. It is rather calculated from the base crit chance, including the bonus received by daggers[1]. Each point of crit chance is roughly equivalent to a 2% chance to crit. How the critical hit chance works is discussed in Critical hit chance.
