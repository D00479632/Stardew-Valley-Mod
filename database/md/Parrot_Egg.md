Summons a level X parrot companion, who grants you a Y chance to find gold coins when slaying monsters. Information Source: Monsters • Crates and Barrels • Skull Cavern Treasure Rooms Adventurer's Guild

Purchase Price: N/A Sell Price: data-sort-value="1000 "&gt;1,000g

The **Parrot Egg** is a trinket item obtainable after claiming Combat Mastery. It can be obtained by slaying monsters or breaking crates and barrels in the Mines, Skull Cavern, or Quarry Mine. Drop chances from both methods are affected by daily luck and luck buffs, among other factors. The Burglar's Ring and Monster Compendium do not impact the chance to obtain it from monsters.\[1] There is also a ≈0.6% chance to obtain a Parrot Egg from a treasure chest in the Skull Cavern.\[2]

Equipping the Parrot Egg in the trinket slot causes a parrot to spawn and follow the player around. The parrot causes monsters to occasionally drop gold coins when slain. Each gold coin is worth data-sort-value="250"&gt;250g. The chance for enemies to drop coins (*Y*) depends on the parrot's level (*X*), which ranges from 1 to 4. For each gold coin an enemy drops, it has another chance to drop a gold coin. The chance for and number of gold coins dropped are not affected by Luck, enemy type, location, the Burglar's Ring, or the Monster Compendium.\[3]

## Levels

When the Parrot Egg is dropped, its level ranges from 1 to 4, with a limit depending on the player's total earnings. Each possible level is equally likely once the player has passed the earnings threshold (*e.g.*, there is a 50% chance to get a level 2 parrot if the player has earned between data-sort-value="750000"&gt;750,000g and data-sort-value="1500000"&gt;1,500,000g).\[4] The parrot can be changed to any possible level (accounting for the player's earnings) if re-forged on an Anvil.
