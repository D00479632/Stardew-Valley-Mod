Pine Tree

Information Seed Pine Cone Tapper Product Pine Tar Growth Time Variable

A **Pine Tree** is a common Tree that grows from a Pine Cone. It yields Pine Tar every 5 days when tapped (2 days with a Heavy Tapper). It can be chopped down with an axe, producing Wood, Sap, possible Pine Cones, and possible Hardwood (if the player is a Lumberjack).

A planted Pine Cone grows through four stages before reaching maturity (with twice as much time spent at stage 4). If fertilized, this takes five days (even in Winter). Otherwise, there is a 20% chance per day of growth, except in winter when trees do not grow. The median time to maturity is 24 days, although individual tree growth times will vary considerably.

Chopping a stage 2â€“3 tree with an axe has a chance to drop one wood, depending on foraging level. This doesn't happen when cutting it with other tools.

Pine Trees outside the farm, but not in Pelican Town, can also be tapped or chopped down. These trees will respawn as Stage 3 saplings (20% chance each day) and grow as normal after that, as long as the stump is removed, and there is nothing on the tree's tile.
