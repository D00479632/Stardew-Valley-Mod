## Health calculation different for craftables?

The game shows that the Oil of Garlic and Life Elixir give 89 health but the template calculates them to 90 health. And the Bug Steak gives 30 Health but the template calculates it to 20 health. So far all other items I've checked are correctly calculated. It seems like edible craftables are the exception.--Spaceeinstein (talk) 15:49, 1 January 2021 (UTC)

Thanks for pointing that out; I'll look into it asap! margotbean (talk) 18:51, 1 January 2021 (UTC)

Note that Life Elixir restores health to full, so the number in the tooltip (and the infobox on the page) is meaningless. Still working on correcting Oil of Garlic and Bug Steak. margotbean (talk) 20:02, 27 May 2021 (UTC)

Fixed, all languages. margotbean (talk) 21:54, 28 May 2021 (UTC)

## Merging this template with the main infobox

Hi, I want to suggest to merge this template with Template:Infobox. Almost all fields in the cooking infobox are in presented in the main infobox and other parameters can be added easily. I want to make some templates like RecipeRow that can be used to transclude about items (f.e. we can create GiftRow template that will display info about gifts for a villager). â€”BotAntony (talk) 01:15, 11 December 2023 (UTC)

I don't think that will work. Infobox and Infobox cooking are used in very different ways, and I'd like to phase out Template:RecipeRow after the slew of v1.6 changes. **As I said on my talk page**, we need content editors for the upcoming v1.6 release. We don't need major restructuring right now, especially since the wiki is working as is. I appreciate your ideas, but you need to spend some time making other types of edits and getting to know the wiki first. margotbean (talk) 04:31, 11 December 2023 (UTC)
