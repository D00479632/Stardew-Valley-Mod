Ingredients
Eel (1)
Hot Pepper (1)
Spicy Eel is a cooked dish. It is prepared using either the kitchen inside an upgraded farmhouse or a Cookout Kit.
Note: This recipe is profitable - it will result in profit when using the lowest quality ingredients.
Spicy Eel can be traded from the Desert Trader for 1 Ruby each. It may also randomly appear in Krobus' shop on Saturdays, in the Garbage Can outside the saloon, or in the Stardrop Saloon's rotating stock. The Bookseller may trade 3 Spicy Eel for 1 Treasure Appraisal Guide, provided the player has already obtained the power from that book. Up to 5 Spicy Eel may be sold by the Calico Egg Merchant in the Desert Festival for 10 Calico Eggs each.
Spicy Eel can also be dropped by Serpents in the Skull Cavern (6% chance). A Lava Eel Fish Pond may produce 5 Spicy Eel when the population of the pond is at least 9 (3-4% chance). One Spicy Eel may be received from opening a Mystery Box. Five Spicy Eel can be obtained as a prize from the Prize Machine.
