“ “Sebastian is a rebellious loner who lives in his parents’ basement. He is Maru’s older half-brother, and feels like his sister gets all the attention and adoration, while he is left to rot in the dark. He tends to get deeply absorbed in his work, computer games, comic books, sci-fi novels, and will sometimes spend great lengths of time pursuing these hobbies alone in his room. He can be a bit unfriendly to people he doesn’t know. Could a charming new farmer cultivate the wasteland of his heart? Who knows?” — Dev Update #12

**Sebastian** is a villager who lives in The Mountains north of Pelican Town. He's one of the twelve characters available to marry.

Sebastian lives in the basement of his mother Robin's carpenter shop, north of town.

## Relationships

Sebastian lives with his mother, Robin, along with his step-dad Demetrius and half-sister Maru. Robin sometimes calls him Sebby. He feels that Maru is treated better than he is, and during Winter will talk about building a snow-goon that Demetrius demands he removes; he will then angrily question what his step-father's problem is.

Sebastian is good friends with Sam; the two can be found hanging out at Sam's house or at The Stardrop Saloon playing pool. They also stand together at festivals, along with Abigail.

During the Flower Dance, if neither Abigail nor Sebastian is dancing with the player, Sebastian dances with Abigail.

## Heart Events

### Two Hearts

Enter Sebastian's room when he's there.

**Details**  You find Sebastian working on his computer. He asks you to wait, he needs to finish something. You are given two options, "He is busy, maybe I should leave" or "Stay put". In both options, he quickly finishes his work and then apologizes for making you wait.

- **"Ask him what he was working on"** *(No effect on friendship.)* He says "I do freelance work as a programmer."
- **"Compliment him on his room decor"** *(No effect on friendship.)* He says "Decorations?... Oh, yeah… thanks. I’ve been sticking posters on the walls for years, I guess it’s kinda cluttered."

Sebastian receives a notification from Sam asking to hang out, but Sebastian says would rather not go out. Robin enters his room moments later, telling him that Abigail was looking for him and will stop by later. Sebastian asks whether Robin told her that he was working, and Robin says yes, but Abigail decided that she would probably stop by anyway. Robin leaves the room, and Sebastian expresses his irritation that nobody takes his job seriously.

- **"Ask him about his career goals"** *(No effect on friendship.)* He says he’s saving up to move to the city. He says he prefers working as a freelance programmer because he isn’t part of the corporate rat race and because he feels more comfortable working behind a computer instead of face to face.
- **"Ask him why he doesn't want to see his friends"** *(No effect on friendship.)* He says "I like having friends, I just need a lot of time alone to balance out the social stuff. Sam’s the opposite… he goes crazy if he’s alone for too long. Maybe that’s why I like computers so much… They’re engaging, straightforward, and unselfish. Quite the opposite of a lot of people I know."

He then goes back to work, saying "I need to get this module finished by tomorrow."

### Four Hearts

Go to The Mountain between 11am and 5pm.

**Details**  You see Sebastian working on a motorcycle in the garage at his house. He explains that it belongs to him and sometimes he goes for long rides alone far away from Stardew Valley. He suggests the possibility of you one day taking a ride with him, to which you agree or disagree.

**That sounds fun.** *(No effect on friendship.)*

Sebastian responds "Great."

**No thanks. That sounds stupid.** *(No effect on friendship.)*

Sebastian responds "Okay... Nevermind then."

**I'm scared of motorcycles.** *(No effect on friendship.)*

Sebastian responds with one of two dialogues, depending on the Player's gender:

- "Don't worry, I'll make sure to show you the ropes before I let you do anything dangerous."
- "There's no need to worry... I'll make sure you're safe."

### Six Hearts

Enter Sebastian's room when he's there.

**Details**  Sebastian greets you, and invites you to play *Solarion Chronicles: The Game* with him and Sam. You play through a scenario, for which you'll be given a score between A and D. You're given a choice of archetype:

- **"Warrior. I like a direct approach."** *(No effect on friendship.)*
- **"Healer. I prefer to help others."** *(No effect on friendship.)*
- **"Wizard. A sharp mind is the most powerful blade of all."** *(No effect on friendship.)*

The classes don't affect friendship, and you can achieve a perfect score with any class:

1. Go through the front door.
2. Choose to fight the skeleton, then raise your shield.
3. Go through the left hallway glowing with a green light.
4. Destroy the capsules.
5. During the final battle:
   
   - **Warrior:** defend your friends while the wizard is mumbling an incantation. You will be able to attack the boss, and the scenario ends.
   - **Healer:** heal Sebastian's wizard. Sebastian is grateful and he defeats the boss.
   - **Wizard:** use "Shield Charm" while the enemy is mumbling an incantation. The enemy wizard shoots a beam at Sebastian, but your "Shield Charm" reflects it and hits the enemy in the face, killing it.

### Eight Hearts

Go to the beach on a rainy day between noon and 11pm.

**Details**  Sebastian is standing on the boardwalk. He's surprised to see you outside in the rain. He says he's anxious around other people, but he doesn't feel that way when he's with you. He takes out an umbrella and motions you to stand under it with him.

### Ten Hearts

Go to The Mountain between 8pm and midnight.

**Details**  Sebastian is outside his house. He says he was about to go for a ride on his motorcycle. You join him for a ride, and he brings you to a place he often goes by himself to think about his life while enjoying a view of the city.

If your character is female, he mentions that he doesn't normally bring girls to this place. Otherwise, he admits that he's never felt this way about other guys, but that you're different.

He pulls on his cigarette a few times, and then asks what you think of the city. You have four options, one of which is telling him to quit smoking. Choosing this one causes Sebastian to be briefly annoyed; he says you sound like his mom, then admits that it's a bad habit and he'll try to stop.

He confesses his true feelings for you, and you embrace under the full moon.

### Group Ten-Heart Event

If the player is unmarried and has given a bouquet to all available bachelors, raised friendship with each bachelor to 10 hearts, and seen each bachelor's 10-heart event, then entering The Stardrop Saloon will trigger a cutscene. If Alex is the final bachelor you share a Ten-Heart Event with, the Group Ten-Heart Event will be unavoidable as it is triggered immediately afterwards.

**Details**  If the player has a Rabbit's Foot in inventory, the cutscene will consist of a friendly game of pool.

If the player does not have a Rabbit's Foot in inventory, all bachelors will express anger about the player dating them all at one time. Regardless of the player's dialogue choice(s), all bachelors will decide to give the player the "cold shoulder" for about a week after the event. They will give angry dialogue when interacted with, and refuse gifts. After about a week, all bachelors will forgive the player, and dialogues return to normal.

This event will trigger only one time per save file. This event will not trigger if you are married or have given a Wilted Bouquet or Mermaid's Pendant to one of the marriage candidates.

### Fourteen Hearts

Go to The Mountain on a rainy day between 6am and 7pm.

**Details**  Sebastian is near the lake when he notices you. He's relieved at your arrival and requests your help to save an injured frog hiding in the bushes. You walk to a bush on his left and shake it, causing the frog to run in Sebastian's direction. He catches it successfully, then examines the frog worriedly; his leg is too injured. You can respond with the following:

- **"What should we do with him?"** *(No effect on friendship.)*
- **"It's our new son..."** *(No effect on friendship.)*
- **"I don't think he's going to make it"** *(No effect on friendship.)*
- **"Let's nurse him back to health!"** *(No effect on friendship.)*

Sebastian responds based on your choice (teasing you if you say the frog is their son), then he decides to take the frog home with him.

Enter your farmhouse between 6:20am and 7pm the next day to trigger the next part of the event:

Sebastian has replaced his Solarion Chronicles table with a terrarium in his spouse room. He explains that he made the terrarium for the frog, since it couldn't survive in the wild anymore. He's pleased that the frog is in better health, but wonders if it will be lonely. You can respond to him here:

- **"Why not start a 'frog sanctuary'?"** *(No effect on friendship.)*
- **"He’ll be fine."** *(No effect on friendship.)*

Choosing the frog sanctuary option makes him enthusiastic about making a haven for frogs, while the latter option has him agree, but still wish the frog had a friend. Another prompt appears:

- **"Why do you like frogs so much, anyway?"** *(No effect on friendship.)*
- **"I don't really want this in the house"** *(No effect on friendship.)*
- **"I'm glad you've found a new hobby"** *(No effect on friendship.)*

If you ask him why he likes frogs, he tells you that he gained a natural affinity for frogs from being out in the rain. If you congratulate him on his new hobby, he enthuses about having a physical hobby and says he might even consider frog breeding.

Telling him you don’t want the frogs in the house makes him firm in keeping them, and tells you that he can do whatever he wants in his spouse room.

After the event, Sebastian's spouse room permanently changes to have a terrarium containing frogs.

## Marriage

*Main article: Marriage*

Once married, Sebastian will move into the farmhouse. Like other marriage candidates, he will add his own room to the right of the bedroom. He'll also set up a small area behind the farmhouse for his motorcycle, and sometimes go there to work on it.

On mornings when Sebastian stays inside the farmhouse all day, he may offer you Coffee. On rainy days, he may offer you a gift he found in "the caves": Obsidian, Void Essence, Bat Wing, Frozen Tear, Amethyst, or Cave Carrot. On New Years Eve (Winter 28), he'll give you a Beer to celebrate the new year.

“ “Hey. How'd you sleep last night? I heard you mumbling. You seemed scared, but I have to admit... it was kind of cute.”

“ “I couldn't sleep last night so I went for a night ride on the motorcycle. I need to stay independent, even though we're married. That's just how I am. I still love you, though.”

“ “The older I get, the less I'm drawn to the city. It had a certain mystique to it, once. But it turns out that was just a romantic fantasy. The city's so busy, so full of people... I don't belong there. I'm a loner.”

“ “Well, this place sure beats my old basement room, doesn't it?”

“ “You don’t ever have to worry about me. I like to spend a lot of time alone.”

“ “Hey, do we have any pizza in the freezer? I'm hungry.”

*In bed*

*Giving coffee*

“ “Hey...want some coffee? I needed some...woke up early from a nightmare and I just couldn't fall back asleep.”

**Outdoor Days**

“ “I'll just watch you from here. I enjoy watching you.”

“ “Hm...Sometimes I have to force myself to stay outside for health. I dunno what it is, but I like being indoors. Maybe I'm just so used to my dark basement.”

“ “I don't want to get soft now that I'm a married guy. Maybe I should start eating more hot pepper and working out? Just an idea...”

“ “We should raise more slimes. In big quantities they can be really profitable. And they're so easy to raise. Also, different color slimes produce different items. I dunno, I think it'd be kind of a fun hobby for us.”

“ “This is so different from my old life, but I'm really starting to like it. I feel like I really belong here.”

“ “Standing at this spot really makes me want a smoke... but I'm determined to quit now.”

“ “It's really cool to have our own place. I can do whatever I feel like and not have people nagging at me all the time. I'm sure Maru's happy that I'm gone.”

“ “Hey. I just hung out around the house, today. Nothing interesting... The view from our house is perfect. You can see the sun setting over Pelican Town from the front porch.”

“ “Maybe I drank too much coffee... I don't feel very tired. I'm still trying to adjust to the farm schedule. I used to stay up until 5 am and sleep in until 2pm, sometimes.”

“ “I spotted a bat out the window earlier. It's kind of hard to see, but if you stay focused you can often catch them flittering about. They're out there.”

“ “I may be a reclusive guy, but I'm always happy when you're around.”

“ “Hi, \[Player]. Good to see you. It's comforting when you're around.”

**Rainy Days**

“ “Finally... some heavy rain. I get bored of sunny weather easily.”

“ “Hey, another rainy day... perfect. You look cold...here, come closer.”

“ “Hey. I was just thinking about my old room in the basement. I felt comfortable there, but this is a lot more interesting. And I don't miss the smell... I felt kind of embarrassed living in my mom's house for so long.”

“ “Seems like a pretty good day to just lay around, maybe read a book or something... what do you think?”

“ “I got up just before dawn and took a walk around the farm. It's really peaceful at that hour.”

*Giving gift*

“ “Hey. I couldn't sleep last night so I took a walk to the caves. I found this ...want it? I just have trouble sleeping sometimes, it has nothing to do with you. I love you.”

**Rainy Nights**

“ “I did some work on the laptop today. I was actually brainstorming some ideas for a game I want to make. With your farming income, I can afford to do what I want with my life. It's pretty amazing. Thank you.”

“ “How was your day? Did you slay any monsters? It feels good to take out your aggression now and then, doesn't it.”

“ “I'm trying my best to quit smoking now that we're married...I don't wanna die on you. It's a bad habit. I want to have a future together.”

“ “Maybe a witch will visit us tonight? Hah...if only life was that interesting...”

“ “Sorry, I didn't make any dinner. We might have a frozen pizza in the fridge or something. I dunno, my mind was elsewhere. It's hard to remember to do chores...”

“ “I'll never grow tired of the rain...especially out here on the countryside.”

“ “I’m glad you’re home... It’s a good night to stay inside.”

**Item blocking Sebastian's path**

“ “You could have cleaned up in here a little while I was gone... It's not very nice to have to wade through a bunch of junk after a hard day's work.”

**High Hearts**

“ “Hey. Look at me. Never forget that I love you... you're everything to me. Now go make us some money.”

“ “Hey... Come here. You look great today.”

“ “You always look great, even after slopping around in the yard all day.”

“ “I don't often show it, but I'm really happy that I'm your husband. Marrying you was the best decision I ever made.”

“ “You don't ever have to worry about me. I like to spend a lot of time alone.”

“ “Sometimes I feel so angry...but when you show up I always start to calm down. Maybe I'll mellow out with age.”

“ “I know you're tough, but I still worry about you, sometimes. Don't ever go monster hunting without a life elixir and some sturdy boots, okay?”

“ “I don't really feel like doing work today. Maybe I'll see what's on TV.”

“ “I don't really need friends. You're the only person I need in my life. Is that weird? I guess I'm not like most people.”

“ “\[Player]? I just want to say that I appreciate all the hard work you do for our household.”

**Neutral Hearts**

“ “When I take walks I do my best to avoid everyone. I hate being pressured into small talk.”

“ “Why don't you tell me about your day when we're in bed tonight? I'm kind of busy right now...”

“ “Are you going in town today? Why? What are you up to?”

“ “I guess I can do the laundry today... You probably have your hands full with running the farm.”

“ “Are we doing okay on money? I don't want to have to sell my laptop...”

“ “If you need to go see your friends in town, go ahead. I like being alone, anyways.”

“ “House-cleaning isn't fun, but when I listen to music and it goes by pretty fast.”

**Low Hearts**

“ “Look, I just want to be alone. Why don't you go outside and do your own thing for a while?”

“ “What do you want? You sound like my step-dad. Go away.”

“ “This place is starting to feel like a tomb.”

“ “I started smoking again... I've just been really stressed out lately.”

**Going Out**

“ “I'm going to take a walk today. I need some time to myself. I'll see you in the evening.”

*At Robin's house*

“ “Mom's face lit up when I walked in. She deserves to be happy.”

*At home*

“ “My day was fine, nothing much to tell you about. Why don't you tell me about yours?”

**When Sebastian gives you a Stardrop**

“ “I'm still getting used to being a father. Don't worry, I'll take good care of &lt;child's name&gt;! It's just... something new.”

“ “Maybe when &lt;child's name&gt; is a little older, I'll get a sidecar for the bike and we can all go for a ride.”

“ “Have you smelled &lt;child's name&gt;? Maybe it's time for a bath...”

**After having two children**

“ “Don't worry, I already fed the kids... \[child] spilled the chocolate milk all over my shirt again.”

“ “I hope &lt;child's name&gt; and \[child] are nice to each other. Maru and I always fought as kids. If I think back on it, it was mostly my fault...”

“ “I've had this recurring dream that \[child] is wearing a shadow shaman costume and sitting on a glowing pumpkin. Weird, huh?”

“ “We've come a long way, \[Player]. Look at our family. To be honest, I never really thought I'd end up in this situation. Now that I'm here, I like it...”

“ “Everything went well, and now little &lt;child's name&gt; is part of the family. We're very fortunate.”

“ “Just look at our little family... We've come a long way, haven't we?”

**Spring**

“ “Wow, my skin is pale... I guess I'd better help you with some farm work this season.”

“ “Ugh...Yes dear? Ugh...do we have to? Alright.”

**Summer**

“ “I'm going to stay inside as much as possible this summer.”

*Summer 1*

“ “Summer's here... I need to start slathering the sunscreen pretty thick if I want to maintain my pale complexion...”

*Day before the Luau*

“ “Have you thought about what you're going to put in the luau soup? I have no idea what's good... you're the chef!”

*Day before the Dance of the Moonlight Jellies*

“ “The weather's starting to cool off. It feels great. Should we go to the festival tomorrow night? It's actually a tradition I kind of enjoy.”

**Fall**

“ “My mother used to always make this delicious pumpkin soup in the fall.”

“ “Winter’s just around the corner. We need to double-check the heating system, turn off the valves, and check all the insulation in the house. Don’t worry, I’ll take care of it all.”

*Fall 1*

“ “It seems like the whole valley's changed overnight... I guess fall's finally here.”

*Day before the Fair*

**Special Summit Cutscene Dialogue**
