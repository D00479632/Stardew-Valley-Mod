Enchantments
I think that the transcluded area in the Enchantments section of the page should be either altered or removed. Right now, that section contains a lot of info that isn't really relevant to tools. The link is there, so if people want to find out more about that topic, they could just go to the relevant page instead. As this would be a fairly substantial change, I wanted to open it up for discussion first. Any thoughts? Cheese80 (talk) 09:49, 22 August 2024 (UTC)
Fixed! Thanks for your comment, there was a lot of unnecessary info on the page! margotbean (talk) 21:25, 22 August 2024 (UTC)
Lost Pan
I accidentally put my pan in the trash in my inventory! Is there any way to get it back? - Insanity (talk) 14:53, 29 September 2024 (UTC)
