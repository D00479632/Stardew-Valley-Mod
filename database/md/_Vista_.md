'Vista' This furniture can't be placed outdoors. Information Source(s) Fishing outside of Spa Sell Price Cannot be sold

'**Vista'** is a piece of furniture that hangs on a wall. It can be obtained by fishing in the pond against the outside of the Spa. The first time fishing there will always result in obtaining the painting (unless the player is completing the secret, in which case it will be obtained the next time they fish there). After obtaining one painting, each cast gives an 8% chance to obtain another painting.\[1] The painting cannot be obtained in Winter since the water will be frozen.
