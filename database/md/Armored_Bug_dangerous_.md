## Behavior

They behave identical to their weaker counterpart the Armored Bug. They fly back and forth in a vertical straight line between walls or objects. They are not aggressive, but will deal damage to the player if touched from the front.

## Strategy

They can only be killed with the Bug Killer enchant, and should be left alone otherwise. Clearing obstacles in their flight path, such as stones, can give them more room to move which also gives the player more time to avoid them.

## Bugs

If the player stands close to a wall or another impassable object while colliding with the Armored Bug, it will permanently freeze in its place.
