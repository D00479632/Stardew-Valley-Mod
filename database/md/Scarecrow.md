A **Scarecrow** is a craftable item that prevents crows from eating crops. Scarecrows can be crafted at Farming level 1. Scarecrows are not needed to protect crops grown from Wild Seeds, since crows do not attack them.

Since there are no crows on Ginger Island, no scarecrows need to be planted on the farm there.

## Range

A Scarecrow will protect the surrounding circular area of 249 spaces; 8 spaces each to the north, east, south, and west, as well as 6 spaces each to the northeast, southeast, southwest, and northwest. In other words, it protects a 17x17 area, excluding 10 spaces in each corner.

## Rarecrows

**Rarecrows** work the same way as regular Scarecrows, except for the Alien Scarecrow, which hats can be placed on. Soon after collecting all 8 rarecrows (usually the next day) a letter will arrive with the recipe to craft a Deluxe Scarecrow.
