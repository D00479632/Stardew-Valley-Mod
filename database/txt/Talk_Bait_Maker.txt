Legendary Fish
The article tells that legendary fish can be put into a bait maker. Ok. Why would anyone do that? The extended family of legendary, sure. But the originals that can only be caught once per savefile? Should there not be some mention of why not to do this? And is that not actually a bug? Giles (talk) 16:22, 17 August 2024 (UTC)
Multiplayer, so your friends can hook the fish quicker? I don't know, personally, I would restart the day if I accidentally made my legendary fish into bait, but that's just me... I would do the same if I turned them into sashimi or quality fertilizer. margotbean (talk) 19:20, 17 August 2024 (UTC)
I never play multiplayer, but I thought they still could be caught only once per file - not once per player? Anyway, I still think it's worth mention in the article. There are plenty of notes, cautions, and tips in other articles. So why not reword what I said rather than remove it? Giles (talk) 23:06, 17 August 2024 (UTC)
Why would anyone do that?As Sheldon says in TBBT:Because we can.The originals can be caught once dont mean you can get only 1 fish,instead,it`s up to 3 fishes if you want.(equiping Challenge Bait).I have 7 Cabins and one of them I copy the museum,I can hold exhibitions on different topics.（including Bait exhibition）No joking,I`m serious.
The point I want to make is that the originals no longer that rare in patch 1.6.You can cook it,smoke it or put it into bait maker to obtain Targeted Bait.Remember it`s an open-ended game!骑凤散人 (talk) 00:13, 18 August 2024 (UTC)
So then, the v1.6 update means that the original legendaries can be caught multiple times per save file? If so, the Wiki needs updating too. Or is this change only for multiplayer? Giles (talk) 23:49, 27 August 2024 (UTC)
There is no change, Legendary fish could always be caught once per save file, or once per player in multiplayer. With Challenge Bait, it's possible to reel in up to 3 of a legendary fish with one catch. Difficult, but not impossible. margotbean (talk) 01:29, 28 August 2024 (UTC)
The current text of the wiki says this: 'It will then produce from 5 to 10 "[insert fish name here] Bait," which will increase the chance to catch that fish when attached. Any fish can be used, including Legendary Fish and Crab Pot Fish.' This wording suggests, to me as a reader, that using Targeted Bait made from a Legendary Fish will increase the chance to catch that Legendary Fish. I don't know personally whether this is true or not, but if in most situations it is not true, then maybe some clarification would be good. Cheese80 (talk) 07:21, 28 August 2024 (UTC)
Thanks for the clarification, Margot. I agree with Cheese80 about clarification in the article. If someone walks into this trap unwittingly, I'm sure they'll be rather disgruntled. Giles (talk) 18:06, 28 August 2024 (UTC)
Remember two things: The wiki's job is not to give advice, and the details of using Targeted Bait appear on the Targeted Bait page. margotbean (talk) 00:46, 29 August 2024 (UTC)
Agreed; good points. And the details of the Bait Maker appear on the Bait Maker page also, yes? So, we're talking about a decision to use the Bait Maker or not. It's not about the bait itself. And while I call this a trap here, that's not language to use in the article. As for advice, the Wiki does sometimes supply it covertly in tips. I think there's a line we're not crossing there, yes? I get it: caution and discretion are in order. Giles (talk) 02:57, 29 August 2024 (UTC)
That said, I'm not sure what can be said in the article, though. My basis has always been single player, and that's where it's a trap. Multiplayer brings a whole new outlook to the procedure because of "one catch per player per savefile". Am I the only one around who doesn't play multi-player? Giles (talk) 03:06, 29 August 2024 (UTC)
I don't have time to play multiplayer, other than for testing purposes. I've added a note to the page which hopefully clears up any confustion. margotbean (talk) 16:46, 29 August 2024 (UTC)
Thanks! That's perfect! Giles (talk) 17:30, 29 August 2024 (UTC)
