## Tailoring

Void Salmon can be used in the spool of the Sewing Machine to create the Fishing Hat. It can be used in dyeing, serving as a purple dye at the dye pots, located in Emily's and Haley's house, 2 Willow Lane.

## Fish Pond

Void Salmon can be placed in a Fish Pond, where they will reproduce every 4 days. The initial pond capacity is 1 fish, but the capacity can be increased to 10 by completing four quests. When the population of the pond reaches 3, the color of the water changes to purple. The primary output is purple Void Salmon Roe, but more valuable items are possible starting at population 8.
