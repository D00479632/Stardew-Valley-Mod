The **Rainbow Trout** is a fish that can be caught in the river (in Pelican Town and Cindersap Forest) and the mountain lake during Summer during sunny weather. It can also be gifted by a pet cat with max friendship. It can also randomly be found in Garbage Cans during Summer, or at the Traveling Cart for data-sort-value="65"195–1,000g.

Rainbow Trout can be caught regardless of weather, time, or season using Magic Bait. On Summer 20th and 21st during the Trout Derby festival, Rainbow Trout can be caught in the Cindersap Forest during the entire day and regardless of weather. The fish can also be caught during Trout Derby without the normal restrictions in Farm Maps with Cindersap Forest fish, such as the Riverland, Hilltop, Forest, and Meadowlands farms.
