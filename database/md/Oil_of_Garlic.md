Drinking Oil of Garlic gives the Oil of Garlic Buff which lasts for 10 minutes (real-time). The Oil of Garlic Buff prevents enemies from spawning in The Mines, except on Dungeon Floors.\[1] In Skull Cavern, it prevents floors from being infested, which does not include Prehistoric Floors\[2], and also prevents swarms of monsters on any level\[3]. The Buff has no effect in Dangerous Mines or Dangerous Skull Cavern.\[4]

It is a special-effect buff, meaning that drinking Oil of Garlic will not remove any buffs from other drinks, or vice-versa.

**Note**: this recipe is profitable - it will always result in profit when using the lowest quality ingredients.
