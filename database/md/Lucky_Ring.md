## Dyeing

The Lucky Ring can be used in dyeing, serving as a yellow dye at the dye pots, located in Emily and Haley's house, 2 Willow Lane.

## Panning

The Lucky Ring can drop from panning and the odds are heavily influenced by daily luck and luck buffs. The formula is `(0.4 + x * 0.04 + y) * (x * 0.002 + y)` where x is the player's luck buff and y is their daily luck.\[2]
