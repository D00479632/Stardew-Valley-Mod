The **Iridium Band** is a ring that can be crafted after earning the recipe at Combat Level 9. The ingredients are 5 Iridium Bars, 50 Solar Essence, and 50 Void Essence. It may also be found in Fishing Treasure Chests after reaching Fishing level 2. Iridium Golems have a 0.1% chance to drop an Iridium Band. Additionally, there is a very small chance it can be obtained by killing monsters or breaking crates/barrels as a special item in The Mines during the Danger In The Deep quest or after activating the Shrine of Challenge.

The Iridium Band combines the effects of the Glow Ring, Magnet Ring, and Ruby Ring. Its effects stack with another Iridium Band, a Glow Ring, a Glowstone Ring, a Magnet Ring, or a Ruby Ring. It displays a purple band with four different gems on them, presumably Ruby, Emerald, Topaz, and Aquamarine. However, it does not have the effects of the latter three.

## Dyeing
