## Tackle profits

Hello Emmeka! The reason I placed profitability info at the bottom of the page is that the Barbed Hook already had that info in a "Notes" section. So, tackle pages don't necessarily need to match cooking pages, but it's good if they match each other. Thanks for your understanding, and for calculating the profitability of the tackles! margotbean (talk) 16:39, 9 July 2022 (UTC)
