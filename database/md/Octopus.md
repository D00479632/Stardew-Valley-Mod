The **Octopus** is a fish that can be caught in the ocean at The Beach or on the Beach Farm during Summer or in the ocean on Ginger Island West during any season. It can also randomly be found in Garbage Cans during Summer, or at the Traveling Cart for data-sort-value="150"450–1,000g. There is a 2.2% chance to hook an Octopus during the deep-sea submarine ride at the Night Market during Winter 15-17 (1.6% if using a Curiosity Lure).

Octopus can be caught regardless of time of day or season using Magic Bait.

The Octopus and the Stonefish are the only fish caught with a fishing rod that cannot be eaten unless used in a recipe.

Other than Legendary Fish, this is the most difficult fish to catch in the game.

## Map

The Octopus can be found in the ocean at the Beach or the ocean on Ginger Island West.

## Strategy

This is an extremely difficult fish to catch, even compared to Legendary Fish. To make it more demanding, the chances of hooking an octopus and the window of time to catch it are very small.

- The difficulty of Octopus can be halved by having the Blessing Of Waters Buff active, which decreases the difficulty of the Octopus by 50%, making its difficulty lower than the normal difficulty of the Largemouth Bass. However, the buff is only active for the first three fish hooked (even if they escape).
  
  - Using Octopus Bait will significantly increase the chances of hooking an Octopus on each cast, making it very likely at least one Octopus will be among the first three fish hooked.
- If the player does not have a Statue Of Blessings, the most efficient way to try to catch an Octopus is to use an Iridium Rod or Advanced Iridium Rod, eat a food that provides a fishing Buff, and attach a Trap Bobber and/or Cork Bobber to the fishing pole. Deluxe Bait can be used to slightly increase the size of the fishing bar, making it less likely for the Octopus to escape.
