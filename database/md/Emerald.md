**Emerald** is a Mineral. It can be obtained from Emerald Nodes and Gem Nodes in the Mines, from panning, or in Fishing Treasure Chests. It has a 10% chance to be dropped by a slain Dwarvish Sentry in the Volcano Dungeon. It may occasionally be found in a Garbage Can after the player has reached the bottom of the mines. It can also be received as a gift at the Feast of the Winter Star. The Statue Of Endless Fortune produces an Emerald on the birthdays of Clint, Emily, and Penny.

Cheese may be purchased at the Desert Trader on Fridays in exchange for 1 Emerald.
