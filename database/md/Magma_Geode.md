## Quests

Three Magma Geodes may be requested by the Raccoon at the Giant Stump as part of his fifth request, or as part of any request starting with the sixth.

## Trivia

- By multiplying the sell price of each item by the chance to obtain it and how many you would receive on average (with ores, clay, and stone) and adding those products together, you can find the average profit of breaking open a single magma geode. Magma geodes have an average return of data-sort-value="167.34"&gt;167.34g. With the Gemologist Profession, magma geodes have an average return of data-sort-value="207.87"&gt;207.87g. A magma geode will sell in the shipping bin for data-sort-value="150"&gt;150g. It is therefore profitable to process magma geodes through Geode Crusher and sell the contents.
