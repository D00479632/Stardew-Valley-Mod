The **Pufferfish** is a fish that can be caught in the ocean at The Beach or on the Beach Farm on sunny summer days between 12pm and 4pm, or on Ginger Island during any season on Island West (ocean), South, Southeast, and in the Pirate Cove. It can also randomly be found in Garbage Cans during Summer, or at the Traveling Cart for data-sort-value="200"600–1,000g.

Pufferfish can be caught regardless of weather, time, or season using Magic Bait.

The Pufferfish and the Blobfish are the only fishing rod fishes that have a "floater" behavior in the fishing mini-game.
