## Behavior

Their behavior is similar to that of Bats and Serpents; they may fly away from the player and change the direction of attack.

They have 2 methods of appearing:

- They can be regular enemies on the floor. Approaching them makes them active and they will attack the player from this point on.
- They can appear at random. They will screech and then one will approach from a random direction outside the floor.

## Strategy

The best weapon may be a regular sword swing (not a club or dagger), since its angle is large. If possible, move in a contrary direction to the Skull so a mob is all on one side of the player, and swing at them all at once.
