## Infobox changes

Hello Skenvy, and welcome to the wiki!

Regarding the recent changes to Template:infobox animal, it's important to discuss changes to templates before they're made, since templates are the same across all 12 languages. (You can read Help:Editing for more basic guidelines.)

So, I'm going to revert the changes, and create a discussion topic on Template talk:Infobox animal. This way we can discuss any potential problems, and evaluate the change there, with more visibility.

Thanks very much, margotbean (talk) 19:44, 12 November 2021 (UTC)
