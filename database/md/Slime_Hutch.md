## Behavior

After purchasing the Slime Hutch, Marlon will visit the player, providing them with a Slime Egg to start breeding Slimes. The Slime Hutch must contain at least 5 slimes before producing Slime Balls.

The Slime Hutch contains 4 water troughs which must be filled in order for the Slimes to produce Slime Balls. The troughs can be filled by the player using a Watering Can or by placing Sprinklers within range.

Slimes in the hutch will attack the player; obtaining the Slime Charmer Ring will prevent damage and debuffs from the Slimes. Slimes in a Slime Hutch do not award Combat XP.

A Random Event can occur whereby a Witch turns all the slimes in a hutch into Black/Transparent Slimes.

## Slime Eggs

Building a Slime Hutch unlocks the ability for slimes to occasionally drop Slime Eggs. These can be used in the Slime Hutch to hatch into Slimes. There are currently 5 kinds of Slime Eggs which will hatch into their respective slime colors/patterns: green, blue, red, purple, and tiger.

Eggs can also be generated for the hutch by using 100 Slime in a Slime Egg-Press. While 4 colors can be obtained this way (excluding Tiger Slime eggs), green eggs have a much greater chance of being produced.

Slimes will not drop slime eggs until a Slime Hutch has been built by Robin. However, they will continue to occasionally drop slime eggs even if the Slime Hutch has been demolished.

## Mating

Sometimes, a Female slime might mate with a Male slime (which have the round antenna). If both slimes show a heart, they will create a baby slime (same HP as the parents, half the size). One might have a heart and the other an exclamation mark, which means the latter refused the advances of the former.

### Mating Color Results

The game randomly picks a method from the following table to determine how the color will be calculated. Using this chosen method each of the red, green, and blue color components of the slime is then calculated independently using the values from the parent Slimes. The most likely method has a separate roll for each color component to determine whether the maximum or the average of the parents' components will be used. \[1]
