Mini-Shipping Bin Items placed in it will be included in the nightly shipment. Information Source(s) Special Order quests Sell Price Cannot be sold

The **Mini-Shipping Bin** is a placeable item that is rewarded after completing either of the Special Orders "Crop Order" or "Pierre's Prime Produce". It can also be purchased from Qi's Walnut Room for data-sort-value="60"&gt; 60.

The bin can be placed on or off the farm and functions as a miniature version of the Shipping Bin. Similar to the shipping bin, the contents of mini-shipping bin are cashed in at the end of the day, but the mini-shipping bin has a maximum of nine slots that can be filled (each slot can be filled with stacks) and the items placed within the slots can be removed at any point throughout the day.

## Trivia

- The letter Pierre sends the day after completing "Pierre's Prime Produce" implies that the Mini-Shipping Bin may be used to send quality crops directly to Pierre's General Store as player-derived stock, but this is not the case.
- The Mini-Shipping Bin may not be picked up into the player's inventory if there are items waiting to be shipped inside.
