Barbed Hook Makes your catch more secure, causing the "fishing bar" to cling to your catch. Works best on slow, weak fish.

The **Barbed Hook** is a tackle that helps fishing by keeping the fishing bar attached to the catch. It can be crafted or purchased from Willy's Fish Shop for data-sort-value="1000"&gt;1,000g after reaching Fishing level 8. It may also randomly appear at the Traveling Cart for data-sort-value="500"1,500–2,500g. A Barbed Hook is one of the rewards the player gets the first time they win the fishing competition at the Festival of Ice.

Using two Barbed Hooks on an Advanced Iridium Rod causes the fishing bar to cling more effectively to the catch compared to using one.

Only the Iridium Rod or the Advanced Iridium Rod can equip tackle. The Iridium Rod can only attach one tackle at a time, while the Advanced Iridium Rod can attach two. To attach tackle, left-click on the tackle, then right-click on the rod. To remove tackle, first right-click to remove any bait, then right-click to remove the tackle. For an Advanced Iridium Rod, the left tackle will be the first one removed.

Tackle does not stack in inventory or chests; each tackle takes up one inventory slot.
