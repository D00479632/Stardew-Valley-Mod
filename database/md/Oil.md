**Oil** is a cooking ingredient made from the Oil Maker. It can also be obtained from Pierre's General Store for data-sort-value="200"&gt;200g. Pierre sells Oil in his shop at the Desert Festival for data-sort-value="4"&gt; 4 Calico Eggs. 2-4 Oil may occasionally be found in Supply Crates on the Beach Farm provided the player has upgraded the Farmhouse at least once.

Oil is given no quality rating, so its sell price doesn't benefit from quality increases. It also does not benefit from the Artisan Profession. Its main benefit lies in its use as a cooking ingredient. Oil made from base quality sunflowers, grown sunflower seeds, and gold or lower qualities of corn is profitable, though corn is more profitable in the Keg, Preserves Jar, or Seed Maker.
