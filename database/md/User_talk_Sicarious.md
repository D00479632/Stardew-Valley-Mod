Hey, since you are doing Mushroom Log editing, I would like to remind you that the nearby trees affect the product of a log in several different ways:

- Quantity - All trees are concerned, **no matter if it's mature or not**.
- Type - All trees give a mushroom to the random list, using the basic distribution. And **only the mature ones** give out one more mushroom according to their type.
- Quality - Similar to Quantity, all trees are concerned. So it is possible for a log to guarantee iridium products, as unmature trees have no grow limit.

Thank you for your work! Ethan (talk) 09:32, 13 April 2024 (UTC)

Good catch, I'd missed that immature trees counted towards quality and quantity. I'll have to expand the quality table a bit, and I might make some reference to the immature trees counting as well. Sicarious (talk) 10:05, 13 April 2024 (UTC)

## Good catch on Lava Eel spawn rates

I had a feeling the spawn rates for Lava Eel in the Forge were nerfed in 1.6 but I wasn't sure on how it got nerfed so I left it with the 1.5 percentage chances just in case it wasn't.

I have a question though: shouldn't daily luck not be counted since "ApplyDailyLuck" is set to false? User314159 (talk) 16:26, 15 April 2024 (UTC)

Ah, good catch, got so caught up in figuring out the maths that I forgot to check that ApplyDailyLuck was actually active in the Location files. Turns out it literally only applies to Woodskip on the Forest Farm specifically. Good spot, I'll update that now. Sicarious (talk) 03:46, 16 April 2024 (UTC)

## Optimal layout of big shed for iridium scythe harvesting

Question about your uploaded screenshot: Your optimal layout has 4 unreachable spots that you use for lighting. Couldn't you reduce the unreachable spots, by extending the top horizontal walkpaths by one (by removing 1 pot on each side)? That would allow you to reach all 4 previously unreachable spots. P.S.: Not sure if this is how you asks questions here, literally registered just for this a minute ago. Mr. Pibortot (talk) 18:20, 18 May 2024 (UTC)

No, reach is somewhat directional. You can reach upwards 3 tiles, but only downwards 2 tiles. So extending the top pathways would only extend access to the topmost lights, not the middle ones. Sicarious (talk) 05:26, 8 October 2024 (UTC)
