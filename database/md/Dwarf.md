“ “Long ago, my people knew the secrets of advanced technology. The archaeological evidence proves that. But I wonder where it came from? And where did it all go? I guess some questions will never be answered...” — Dwarf

The **Dwarf** is a valley resident who lives in the Mines. Initially the way is blocked off by an unbreakable rock, just inside the entrance. After upgrading to at least a steel pickaxe, the stone can be broken. A cherry bomb (or stronger bomb) will also break the rock.

The Dwarf will start out speaking Dwarvish, which is unreadable by the player. To understand Dwarvish the 4 Dwarvish scrolls must be acquired from within the mines. After donating them to the museum, Gunther will reward the player with the Dwarvish Translation Guide to use which allows for understanding the Dwarf's speech. Purchases from the Dwarf's shop cannot be made and friendship cannot be affected with the Dwarf until Dwarvish is understood.

## Schedule

The Dwarf lives just to the east of the entrance to the mines and does not move from there.

**Notes**

- During year 1, it is cheaper to buy the ingredients for Bomb at the Blacksmith and craft them, provided the player has the sufficient Mining level 6. Buying 4 Iron Ore and 1 Coal costs data-sort-value="750"&gt;750g vs data-sort-value="1000"&gt;1,000g to buy it directly from Dwarf. Buying Wood from the Carpenter's Shop and burning it in a Charcoal Kiln saves an extra data-sort-value="50"&gt;50g - if going this route, it is also data-sort-value="50"&gt;50g cheaper to buy the materials for Cherry Bomb.

## Relationships

Due to a 1000-year war between the Dwarves and the shadow people, The Dwarf is sometimes suspicious of the player, believing they may be a spy sent by the shadow people.

The Dwarf appears to have some respect for the wizard, as seen in their heart event.

The Dwarf harbors dislike for Krobus, on account of the aforementioned war between their people, the outcome of which caused the Dwarf race to disappear, leaving behind only relics (found as artifacts)

## Gifts

*Main article: Friendship*

*See also: List of All Gifts*

You can give the Dwarf up to two gifts per week (plus one on their birthday), which will raise or lower their friendship with you. Note that if you do not understand Dwarvish, friendship will be unaffected by gifts. Gifts on their birthday ( 22 Summer) will have 8× effect and show a unique dialogue.  
For loved, liked, or neutral gifts, the Dwarf responds

“ “Oh! I've read about this tradition... it's a 'birthday gift', isn't it? Hmm, very interesting...”

For disliked or hated gifts, the Dwarf responds

“ “Oh! I've read about this tradition... it's a 'birthday gift', isn't it?

So, is it part of the tradition to give out garbage like this?”

## Heart Events

### 50 Friendship Points

After earning 50 Friendship points with the Dwarf, enter the Sewers. A Stardrop must have been purchased from Krobus.

**Details**  The Dwarf finds Krobus in the Sewers and blames the Shadow People for the death of their family. Krobus retorts by saying that he only resorted to violence after the dwarves drove them from their ancestral homeland. Krobus gives an apology for what happened to the Dwarf's family but the Dwarf doesn't accept it. They both start fighting. The player descends into the Sewers and gets between them. The Dwarf yells out, "Let me at him! He's despicable." Krobus retorts, "Come and get it, shrimpy." Suddenly, the Wizard appears and stops the fight. He reminds them that "The Elemental Wars have long been finished." and tells them to make peace for the sake of the humans that live around them. The Dwarf consents to this and promises to stay away from the Sewers. Krobus once again apologizes for the past and states that he has no personal gripe with the Dwarf. The Wizard casts a 'Seal of Promise' to finalize the agreement.

## Quotes

**First Meeting** 

“ “Hey, you're pretty good at mining, for a human.”

**Regular** 

“ “I got all this stuff from the surface. I just take it from your people during the night. Hmm? What is this concept you call "private property"?”

“ “Ah... cave carrot stew, cave carrot roast, cave carrot soup and cave carrots au gratin.

...And a ramekin of cave carrot brulee to sweeten the night. What?”

“ “Hey, wanna buy something?”

“ “I feel most comfortable underground. The deeper underground the better.”

“ “You've never seen a dwarf before, have you?”

“ “It's dangerous in the mines. Why don't you buy a few things from my shop to ensure your safety?”

“ “One day you'll have to tell me about this beverage you call "milk"”

“ “You're not a spy sent by the Shadow People, are you? I'm keeping my eye on you.”

“ “Most humans fear the unknown... that's why I've hidden my shop here. Your mining skills prove you're trustworthy.”

*6+ Hearts*

“ “Long ago, my people knew the secrets of advanced technology. The archaeological evidence proves that.

But I wonder where it came from? And where did it all go? I guess some questions will never be answered...”

*8+ Hearts*

“ “The mines can be a treacherous place. Be careful, friend.”

**Rain**

“ “Rain... It's almost mythical to us. Some of us dwarves live our entire lives without ever experiencing it.”

**Green Rain**

“ “I can't see the color green very well.#$b#I guess it's part of living underground for so long.”

**After reaching the bottom of the Mines**

“ “You know, you're pretty good at mining, for a human.”

**After reaching Ginger Island North**

“ “You found the legendary Dwarvish Forge? Incredible... I've never seen it, myself.#$e#The machinery is so old, none of my people understand how it works. But it's definitely Dwarvish technology.”

“ “Oh, you caught a Stonefish? I know them very well. We sometimes keep them as pets.”

**After catching an Ice Pip**

“ “Oh, you caught an Ice Pip? They're energetic little fish, despite the frigid environment they live in. My people avoid the frozen areas, though... too cold!”

**After catching a Lava Eel**

“ “Oh, you caught a Lava Eel? Very good! Lava Eel fishing is a big part of our culture. They're considered a delicacy!”

## Trivia

- The Dwarf's gender in the game data is "undefined" (see `Content\Data\NPCDispositions.xnb`).
- The large rock leading to the Dwarf can be destroyed with a cherry bomb (or stronger bomb), but that's not mentioned in the message shown when trying to break it with a low-level Pickaxe.
