A **Mini-Obelisk** is a crafted item that can be placed anywhere within the boundaries of the farm in Stardew Valley (not Ginger Island). Two of them are used as a pair to teleport the player from one to the other.

The crafting recipe is obtained after completing the Wizard's special order quest "A Curious Substance".

## Limitations

- Placing a third Mini-Obelisk on the farm will trigger the error message "You can only place two."
- Placing a Mini-Obelisk outside the farm will trigger the error message "Can only be placed on the Farm." This includes the inside of buildings, *e.g.,* the farmhouse and sheds.
- Placing a single Mini-Obelisk on the farm is permitted, but no transportation is enabled without a second one.
- The Mini-Obelisk cannot be used to transport the horse. The player cannot interact with the Mini-Obelisk while riding the horse.
- The Mini-Obelisk will not function on Ginger Island.
