Iridium Krobus Can be placed as decoration. Information Source(s) Fishing Sell Price Cannot be sold

The **Iridium Krobus** is a decorative piece of furniture. It can be obtained by fishing in the ocean from the southernmost point of Cindersap Forest near the entrance to The Sewers.

A minimum effective Fishing level of 15 is required to achieve the long cast distance required to reach the ocean from Cindersap Forest. This can be achieved by:

- Reaching level 10 Fishing, consuming gold-quality Seafoam Pudding (cooked with Qi Seasoning), and maximizing the casting meter of a rod
- Consuming regular-quality Seafoam Pudding (or a gold-quality food item that normally gives +3 Fishing) and using a rod enchanted with the Master enchantment at the Forge
- Getting the fishing buff from the Chef at the Desert Festival (anything + Shrimp) then eating any food item that gives +2 fishing or higher

The first time fishing there will always result in obtaining the statue. Only one statue can be obtained per player per game.\[1]

If the original is lost, a replacement can be purchased at the Lost Items Shop in the Secret Woods for data-sort-value="10000"&gt;10,000g.

## Glitch

Iridium Krobus can be more easily obtained by using the sword-swing glitch to glitch out of the map and stand closer to the ocean.
