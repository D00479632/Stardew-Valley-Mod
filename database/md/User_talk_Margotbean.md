## Edits on Crops, Spring, and Summer

Hi margotbean, I hope you enjoyed (or still are enjoying) your holidays. I see that you added back the value of data-sort-value="13.33"&gt;13.33g/d to summer squash on both the Crops and Summer pages, but I'm still not sure why you undid the other formatting edits I did on those three pages.

I would appreciate if you could review this changes again when you have time, and should they be ok, perform these edits to the Spring and Summer pages (seeing how you locked all season pages to be only editable by admins). Alt (talk) 08:37, 8 January 2025 (UTC)

Nothing has changed, I reviewed the edits and the pages are fine margotbean (talk) 23:04, 8 January 2025 (UTC)

Ok, I'm not saying the pages weren't fine already, and I really don't mean to be a bother, but I just don't see what's wrong with keeping the formatting of those crop entries consistent across (and within) these three pages. I've edited other wikis before, and inconsistent formatting is something that always irritates me to some extend (I realise this could just be me), so whenever I see inconsistencies in any wiki I read, I always feel an urge to unify the formatting if I can. Also, I re-read Help:Editing again, and I realise I did not discuss any of those changes beforehand, per Help:Editing#Formatting; I sincerely apologise for that. Alt (talk) 00:46, 9 January 2025 (UTC)

## RE: Journal Scrap #9 solution order

Hello MargotBean, I hope you are well. The upkeep of the wiki has been amazing throughout these past upgrades to v1.6+. A certain issue in the wiki has bothered me for some time. RE: Journal Scrap #9, in the solution section, the 2 solutions were listed in the wrong order. The note hints, "*Aye... stones as big as '**ones'** and stones as big as '**fives'** were they...*" therefore the numbers directly **UNDER** the images should be the 2nd shown sequence of "2 clicks, 11 clicks, 9 clicks, 5 clicks, 7 clicks" because this corresponds to the note's hint (2 small stones = 2), (2 large + 1 small = 11), (1 large + 4 small = 9), (1 large = 5), and finally (1 large + 2 small = 7). Then the 2nd sequence, which is 1 note less on each stone than the hint implies, listed as an alternative solution. I believe this alternative may seem to work better for some players not on PC (mobile possibly) but it is not the solution to the hint in the note and should be relegated to the second row. I made the change today, I just don't know how, or if, I'm supposed to do this in other languages. Best Regards, Carpediem (talk) 20:29, 9 January 2025 (UTC) Edit: I also belatedly just made this adjustment on the *Ginger Island / Mermaid* section to switch the order of the 2 solutions (I didn't initially realize it was in another location). Both of these were done on the English wiki only. Carpediem (talk) 22:04, 9 January 2025 (UTC)

That sounds fine, and thanks for your note! Interestingly enough, there was a survey among testers when 1.5 was in beta asking if they thought "5" meant "5 clicks" or "get the flute block to the 5th note". I think musically inclined people (like ConcernedApe) might think differently about the puzzle than others. I can't remember the results of the survey, unfortunately... margotbean (talk) 01:07, 10 January 2025 (UTC)

Hmmm, interesting indeed. I guess I don't see the difference. When 2 big stones will equal 10 and 1 small stone is 1, then 11 "clicks", or "Check / Do Action / Use Cursor" on whatever platform, would bring that fluteblock for the 2nd grouping to its 11th note and thus create the correct sound at that point in the riddle. Maybe "*clicks*" is not the best wording then? Thanks again, be well. Carpediem (talk) 20:56, 10 January 2025 (UTC)

I'm going to give a quick code insight by the way and note that the game only cares about relative pitch; in fact, this means that the first note block can be \*any value* and as long as you go the correct amount up and down for each following block it's valid. The only limitation is that you can't loop around the 24, but that still means there are as many as 16 different valid solutions. So while it's peculiar, 0 9 7 3 5 clicks and 15 24 22 18 20 clicks both work. I don't know if you want to include that or not but it does make saying there's just 2 is incorrect. But I suppose the two listed are the two most intended solutions.CandyNim (talk) 06:43, 11 January 2025 (UTC)

Thank you, that's very interesting. In the beginning there was just the one solution in the wiki and it corresponded to the actual Stone Tuning Key image and the visible position of the stones. A second solution was added at some point and I believe this one was easier for mobile users for some reason (at least according to the SDV subreddit) but it was placed directly under the image, moving the actual solution for the image down a line, with the new solution being incongruous with the Key image. I'm happy it's moved back to its original position.Carpediem (talk) 21:18, 6 February 2025 (UTC)

## Templates for Mobile-View

Hello Margotbean,  
I mostly use the wiki on my phone - have you ever thought about creating/ adjusting templates for mobile view?  
MediaWiki knows the markups for "mobile only" or "mobile-hidden".  
When i worked on a wiki, we created a lot of templates that way. mostly were there only small adjustments eg. description in row below, instead a column on the right - to decrease the width and make tables fitting for smaller screens.  
Would be nice to hear from you, about that idea. i am pretty sure, it would please a lot of users!

## Eggplant Parmesan

Hey margotbean, I just want to apologise for changing the information on the eggplant parmesan page. I promise I wasn't just trying to mess with it. I was playing a save on my switch and it said that they loved it both in the villagers dialogue and in the gift log, but then I just checked it on my pc and it matched the information that's on the eggplant parmesan page now. So I'm not sure what happened with that but I'm sorry for the nuisance. Farmer Ron (talk) 13:07, 18 January 2025 (UTC)

No problem, thanks for the note! You can report the bug on the official forums margotbean (talk) 07:33, 19 January 2025 (UTC)

## Clint broken glasses

I just found out that Clint loves broken glasses and it appears that the wiki dose not show this information It’s not ground breaking or anything I just thought it was interesting. Sweetcheese (talk) 14:40, 18 January 2025 (UTC)

I'm sorry, but according to the data files, Clint doesn't love broken glasses. margotbean (talk) 07:33, 19 January 2025 (UTC)

Clint does not normally love Broken Glasses, this may be a result of the current console bug that allows any item, even trash items, to be a loved gift.Carpediem (talk) 20:58, 6 February 2025 (UTC)

## File block

Hi, you blocked me from uploading files with no reason given. I've resolved the Furniture situation and I'd like to upload more files to help with the wiki, so please unblock me.

Also, I added a section on Talk:Furniture, so pwease talk a look at that as well. Myirlname (talk) 01:17, 24 January 2025 (UTC)

Most of the edits I'm thinking of making involve uploading new files to the wiki, so I can't contribute to the wiki if I'm blocked. Myirlname (talk) 22:52, 28 January 2025 (UTC)

## Edits on Strawberry

Hi, you've reverted my latest changes on Strawberry growth chart. Given this is just an addition of two columns, I'm surprised to see it reverted. I understood previous changes being reverted when I added all the growth charts as there is a desire to keep the page simple and making that sort of change across all the languages would likely be taxing, but in this case even on mobile I don't see this as a major change adding 2 columns to 5. I don't see this as a major formatting change but let me know if I'm not correct. I can't be the only person that comes to the wiki to figure out if buying Strawberries at the Desert festival is worth it to get another handful of strawberries. TheIgle (talk) 14:06, 28 January 2025 (UTC)

## Luau change

Hello,

I received the notification that my edit was canceled because there was no discussion. But I would protest it -- I suggested my idea about 2 month ago on the discussion page, explained the benefit, but I got no response. I would like to know, how should I do under such situation? Also on the Luau discussion page, PrincessFelicity, who wrote in discussion page before me and received no reply too, agreed with my attempt. Now I wonder that "the discussion" actually means your permission.

I of course understand you have so many things to do, there are 12 versions of other languages and synchronizing them needs huge efforts. I also respect you maintaining this wiki. But I hope you know our enthusiasm and attempts to improve this wiki.

I would be happy you understand I never intend to blame you.

Mmtraa7 (talk) 01:34, 2 February 2025 (UTC)

Hello MMtraa! I don't think of a discussion as obtaining permission, but if I haven't commented on the discussion, I probably don't think it's a good idea. margotbean (talk) 16:27, 2 February 2025 (UTC)

Thank you Margotbean, and I am sorry, I still could not accept your comment. I feel so pity if you are just judging everyone's opinion, instead of considering and discussing with us.

I believe my idea surely makes Luau article much better, that is the only reason why I suggestd it.

If you think my idea is not so good, I would like to know why you think so. I cannot interpret how you think from your silence.

As I said in Luau discussion, too many Smoked Smoked and Smoked Fish make the article really difficult to understand or find information. (Even in JA wiki, my native language version, so many くんせい (Smoked) and ワイン (Wine) are terribly annoying and frustrating 😭)

I repeat my intention of this message; I am eager to KNOW what idea you think as good one, and DISCUSS about it with you.

Also, there is other user, PrincessFelicity, who thinks Luau article is so confusing as well, agree with my attempt. I would like you not to ignore him, too.

I think communication is the best way to improve this wiki. So I hope your opinion on this matter. If my brief is wrong, please point it out.

Mmtraa7 (talk) 21:00, 2 February 2025 (UTC)

Yes, communication is important. I spend the bulk of my time communicating with editors, and so the needed content updates get pushed further down the list. So, two of my reasons are these:

1. No one has done a code run-through to ensure all items are listed and up-to-date. Format follows content; content comes first.
2. No one has indicated that they understand the huge commitment it takes to change the page in twelve languages.

--margotbean (talk) 22:03, 2 February 2025 (UTC)

Sorry, I am late to reply;

I do understand you have so many things to do, but I haven't found a Stub tag or Under Construction tag on Luau page. That's why I think we now can (and should) think about format.

Now, to avoid confusion, I can add such tag for you, because this issue is often put on the table in Luau talk page (means some people do think this is a matter)?

Additionally, I am ready to work on format editing. I know I responsible for my suggestion, and I can understand Japanese, English, and Chinese (a little).

I hope I can do something for this wiki and you.

## Edit to Leprechaun Hat

Concerning the reversion to the edit I made about Spring 17 being a reference to March 17, St. Patrick's Day, and your summary mentioning it should be a note, if anything, I get your reasoning. Why not go ahead and show good editing example by making it into a note instead of merely reverting it then? I get some people have standards set to make the wiki readable and easily accessible. I'm not always the best at understanding what exactly is expected. I just wanted to add a little more info and would like that info to be there, whatever form it has to take.

CD Random (talk)

I understand your confusion. Please feel free to add a "Notes" section to the page with the information you added before. Bonus points if you link to the wikipedia page for St. Patrick's Day, for those countries/languages who don't know what it is. margotbean (talk) 23:54, 3 February 2025 (UTC)

## Item infobox

This is just a little question:

What do the differences in item infobox mean?

For example, on Treasure Chest page, we can find a list in Source section. Like:

* * *

- Artifact Trove (3.7%)
- SquidFest festival
- Fishing Treasure Chest (0.24%)
- Secret Note #16
- Spook Fish (Fish Pond) (0.3%)

* * *

On the other hand, on Pearl page, Source section has a row of obtaining source. It looks:

* * *

Night Market • Golden Fishing Treasure Chests • SquidFest festival • Artifact Trove • Blobfish Fish Pond • Mystery Box • Golden Mystery Box

* * *

Both of Treasure Chest and Pearl are categorized as Special Items. So now I wonder what does the difference of the format mean🤔

## Statue of endless fortune

What was wrong with my calculation for statue of endless fortune? I don't know how to wiki but i thought it would be correct. Why "NO!"?

Nippermuk (talk) 15:40, 11 February 2025 (UTC)

When I wrote "read the talk page", I was referring to Talk:Statue Of Endless Fortune, particularly my comment there that "a general statement is best." margotbean (talk) 16:41, 11 February 2025 (UTC)

## Trying to update guidance on obtaining Mod Author role on Modding:Community marked as harmful

Hey, Margotbean! I'm a moderator on the Discord, and I noticed the guidance/channel names is slightly out of date. I had the edit marked as a minor change, and the only tweaks made were:

From:

Only users who have the Mod Author role on Discord should be listed here. Please ask in the #making-mods channel before adding yourself here.

To:

Only users who have the Mod Author role on Discord should be listed here. Please ask in the #making-mods-general channel, or DM @Bouncer#9811 before adding yourself here.

And from (with links removed here, just in case it triggers it again):

Here are the users on Discord who have the mod author role. If you created a mod and reached level 25 on Discord, feel free to #⁠making-mods! We'll check if you qualify, help you add yourself to the list, and give you the `Mod Author` role. (See Modding:Community/entry|instructions for adding an entry, but please don't add yourself to the wiki before asking.)

To (with links removed here, just in case it triggers it again):

Here are the users on Discord who have the mod author role. If you created a mod and reached level 25 on Discord, feel free to #making-mods-general, or DM *@Bouncer#9811*! We'll check if you qualify, help you add yourself to the list, and give you the `Mod Author` role. (See Modding:Community/entry|instructions for adding an entry, but please don't add yourself to the wiki before asking.)

I don't *feel* like either of these ought to have triggered the harmful warning, given there are no external links.

Thanks for any input you might have!

DecidedlyHuman (talk) 11:35, 14 February 2025 (UTC)

Hello DH! The abuse filter triggers if you edit a section with external links in it, even if you don't change the links. I'll push your edit through today! margotbean (talk) 18:01, 14 February 2025 (UTC)

The truly embarrassing part is that I've specifically told people this exact thing before. Apologies for the brainfart there! DecidedlyHuman (talk) 18:31, 14 February 2025 (UTC)

I won't mention yours if you don't mention mine. 😁 margotbean (talk) 18:44, 14 February 2025 (UTC)

## Jas and Marnie

Why do you keep reverting my edits to the relationships panel for the Jas and Marnie pages? Marnie \*is* Jas's adoptive aunt; to imply that they are actually related causes a lot confusion for players trying to figure out the actual relationship between them. Sinksforsauce11 (talk) 17:21, 17 February 2025 (UTC)

There is no reason given in the game to think that Marnie formally adopted Jas. There is also no reason to think that Marnie is not Jas' aunt by blood. ConcernedApe left the relationship vague, and so should the wiki. margotbean (talk) 17:26, 17 February 2025 (UTC)

There is no reason to think that they are related by blood; Jas's parents are specifically stated to have been "good friends" with Shane, \*not* in any way related to him -- if they were related, ConcernedApe would have said so, instead of calling them friends. Marnie never refers to Jas as her niece in any of her dialogue lines; it is a big jump logically to assume that they are blood related. The wiki is not staying "vague" when the information it states is never provided in the game -- it is simply reflecting YOUR views on what the relationship must be, when those are not actually based in reality. Sinksforsauce11 (talk) 17:38, 17 February 2025 (UTC)

## Flower dance

Hey Margot. I received and email that seems to be your correcting 2nd person pronoun but I never added a 2nd person pronoun. Was this intended for someone else? Surfersurfer (talk) 00:06, 20 February 2025 (UTC)

I didn't send any emails. margotbean (talk) 01:29, 20 February 2025 (UTC)

## Marnie Gifts

Hello, I just wanted to put it out there that Marnie now has Moss as a loved gift, thank you. PaigeLeigh (talk) 01:56, 22 February 2025 (UTC)

## Why on earth did you remove the lewis responses from the luau?!

Title speaks for itself. RocketsRus (talk) 20:01, 26 February 2025 (UTC)

## Mineral Soundalikes

Recently you removed a piece of trivia I put on the alamite page. Just want to let you know that there is also one similar to that one on the bixite page, just in case you want to remove that one too. RawKnowlege1234 (talk) 18:30, 1 Mar 2025 (UTC)

Also, after reading the Leprechaun Hat talk section, maybe the unsupported trivia could go under the notes section? I think it is defitely worth noting on the page. RawKnowlege1234 (talk) 07:41, 2 Mar 2025 (UTC)
