Trout Soup Profitability
I need someone to check my math on this, but I'm pretty sure Trout Soup isn't profitable with Angler profession. Trout Soup only sells for 100g to begin with. 15g for the Green Algae never changes. Rainbow Trout starts at a base sell price of 65g; no problem there. Then, the Fisher profession increases the Rainbow Trout base sell price to 81g. That is not a problem either, although your profit margin is now only 4g instead of 20g. However, if you have the Angler profession, Rainbow Trout is now worth at least 97g starting at base. If you try to make Trout Soup and sell it for profit, each Soup is now netting you -12g. Btw I am not checking any of this in-game, I am getting all these stats from the wiki and a calculator. I think it's worth noting the Trout Soup isn't profitable with Angler Profession, so I'm just putting this out there. Thanks guys Soap-the-gamer (talk) 18 March 2024
Right you are, I'll add a qualifier rather than deleting it completely from the list. üëç margotbean (talk) 18:54, 18 March 2024 (UTC)
