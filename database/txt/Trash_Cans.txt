For the trash cans found around Pelican Town, see Garbage Can.
The Trash Can is a tool used to delete items from the inventory menu, and when upgraded, reclaim some of the items' gold value.
Every player starts with a basic trash can in their inventory, which can be upgraded at the Blacksmith for resources and gold, shown in the table below.
Unlike the other upgradeable tools, the current trash can remains available during the time Clint takes to upgrade it.
