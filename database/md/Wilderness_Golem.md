**Wilderness Golems** are a unique enemy found on farms at night if the player selects the wilderness map as the farm layout. They'll scale in difficulty based on the player's combat level; as the player's level increases so will the monster's difficulty.

Wilderness Golems can also spawn on other farm layouts provided the player has given a Strange Bun to the Dark Shrine of Night Terrors in the Witch's Hut, or chosen the Advanced Option "Spawn monsters on the farm" at new game creation.

## Behavior

They come out of the ground and wander aimlessly and slowly make their way to the player, damaging the player if they collide. Their behavior is the same as Stone Golems.

## Strategy

Swinging at them with a sword is the most effective strategy.

## Trivia

A Wilderness Golem plays a central role in Abigail's 14 heart event.
