Night Market Fish without submarine
Currently the segment states that all 3 of the night market fish can be fished at any time when using Magic Bait. I wanted to see the exact tiles (and maybe percentages) but when I looked through the code I can only see an entry for 798/Midnight Squid. In Beach.cs:getFish there is the additional if (using_magic_bait && bobberTile.X < 12f && bobberTile.Y > 31f && waterDepth >= 3 && Game1.random.NextDouble() < 0.1 + (double)(bobberAddition * 1.5f)) return new Object(798 + Game1.random.Next(3), 1); but I didn't find any entries for blobfish (800) or spookfish (799). Does anyone know where those are hidden? Dubesor (talk) 14:46, 4 May 2021 (UTC)
They are hiding in the last line random.Next(3) returns either 0, 1 or 2, so 798 + 1 = 799 and 798 + 2 = 800. margotbean (talk) 17:28, 4 May 2021 (UTC)
Ah, that makes sense. I was constantly scanning all the .cs files for objects 799 and 800, I didn't even notice it just alters the ID! thanks. Dubesor (talk) 18:23, 4 May 2021 (UTC)
sea jelly
New 1.6.0 fish!
Found: 5pm, Spring, Sunny, Ocean "A rare jelly found in the ocean." +88 Energy, +39 Health, +1 Fishing for 7m
Doesn't have the fish subtype, might list near algae? Seajelly (talk) 19:24, 19 March 2024 (UTC)
Yes, it appears to have the same behavior as algae (considered to be a fish in terms of the fishing achievements), but is otherwise not considered a fish (cannot be sold to Willy at the Fish Shop). User314159 (talk) 20:55, 19 March 2024 (UTC)
Adding Health and Energy to all Fish
Requesting permission to update the table to now include Energy and Health.
Also want to add another table under Sashimi that is meant for health and energy comparisons between making fish into Sashimi vs Smoked Fish. Table will have 2 categories of energy and health of which fish have higher values if you made the fish into sashimi instead of smoked fish. This table should be small considering most fish smoked now will have higher health and energy than sashimi.
Also want to add a table like on the Preserves Jar and Keg pages where is list all the fish that will have a better profit as sashimi. If artesian is required to make smoked worth more I'll add a footnote if it's 1 or 2 and I'll add a whole column if it's 3 or more.
If you need evidence to my previous works on wikis you can find it on the I Shall Seal The Heavens Wiki. I did the entire fight log for the main character in that 9 book series. (unable to direct link due to site policy use google)
If I don't get a response by Friday I'm going to start the work anyway since I'm going to be using it during my next run, I just won't push the info to the wiki.

Glacierfish Behavior
I created an account just to voice this, but can someone tell whether the behavior is something written in the game code or whether it is observed. But I believe that the Glacierfish's behavior should be changed to Dart.
The Glacierfish fit the description of a Dart behavior significantly more than a Mixed behavior. It goes up and down incredibly fast (fits the "2xDifficulty amplitude" part), it does seem to have a speed difference when going up or down, and seems to erratically move to random points on the fishing bar at fast speeds.
To test this opinion I went and hooked a Mutant Carp (Difficulty 80, Dart behavior) and then I hooked a Glacierfish (Difficulty 100, Mixed Behavior) and they do the exact stuff, only difference being that the Glacierfish decides where to move, and moves there faster than the Mutant Carp.
Again, I do not know whether the "Behavior" are a thing that are stated in the code, but I believe the Glacierfish should be a classified as a darter, to be a more accurate description of what to expect when someone goes to hook it for the first time.
Hello! The difficulty rating (100) and behavior (mixed) of the Glacierfish is specified in Content\Data\Fish.xnb. That game file is also where other info like seasons and weather can be found. I hope that was helpful! (Also, if you put four ~ symbols at the end of your message, it automatically signs & dates it) Bluestblur (talk) 14:40, 16 April 2024 (UTC)
Fishing Pole Fish table needs small edit
On the page for Fish, in the table of fish caught with the Fishing Pole, the Ice Pip does not display it's location the same way as the Ghostfish, Stonefish and Lava Eel. Ice Pip is missing the link for The Mines: Instead it displays as simply Mines. Since this is a change that adds a link to the table, I'm not sure that I can make that change myself, as a new account. Jaxwyn (talk) 23:00, 12 May 2024 (UTC)
Tutorial Catch
I don't agree with the reversal made on 23 August, 2024. I don't see how the original text could be better since it implies that I can choose among the list of fish which one I want to catch for the tutorial catch. Rather, the choice is the game's. Giles (talk) 23:44, 27 August 2024 (UTC)
I don't think that's implied. It just says the fish "can be selected" and it never says it's the player who selects it. User314159 (talk) 00:50, 28 August 2024 (UTC)
But the point was that it never said it wasn't the player who selects it, either. It's open-ended, and it ought to be clear whether or not a player has the opportunity to select it. Cheese80's edit perfectly addresses that point. Giles (talk) 18:01, 28 August 2024 (UTC)
I've made a small edit that hopefully clears up the confusion. Cheese80 (talk) 07:02, 28 August 2024 (UTC)
Catfish in Winter
Greetings! I was making a fish odds sheet using data from Fish.XNB and I was surprised to see that the Catfish can be caught in Winter (at least in Town, anywhere where the LOCATION_SEASON flag isn't set with a different conditional). I validated this in a live save in 1.6 using a rain totem, caught a Catfish in town in winter. If that entry could be updated it would be appreciated. Thanks! Giant Octopodes (talk) 12:38, 19 October 2024 (UTC)
Nice catch! Added. User314159 (talk) 01:46, 21 October 2024 (UTC)
Sturgeon able to be caught earlier than table suggests
I am on my first year in summer and have been able to catch a sturgeon at 5:00PM. the table suggests 6-7PM. --Levi1618 (talk) 09:39, 22 February 2025 (UTC)
The table says that the Sturgeon can be caught between 6AM and 7PM. Cheese80 (talk) 11:17, 22 February 2025 (UTC)
