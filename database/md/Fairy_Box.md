The **Fairy Box** is a trinket item obtainable after claiming Combat Mastery. It can be obtained by slaying monsters or breaking crates and barrels in the Mines, Skull Cavern, or Quarry Mine. Drop chances from both methods are affected by daily luck and luck buffs, among other factors. The Burglar's Ring and Monster Compendium do not impact the chance to obtain it from monsters.\[1] There is also a ≈0.6% chance to obtain a Fairy Box from a treasure chest in the Skull Cavern.\[2]

Equipping the Fairy Box in the trinket slot causes a fairy to spawn and follow the player around. It occasionally heals the player during combat. The frequency and amount of health regained depend on the fairy's level, which ranges from 1 to 5.

## Levels

The Fairy Box has a random level between 1 and 5 when dropped, and it can be changed to any random level if re-forged on an Anvil. Higher level fairies heal more frequently and have greater "Healing Power". The exact amount healed is the cube root of all damage dealt or received by the player since they were last healed by the fairy (up to a maximum of 10% of the player's maximum health), multiplied by the fairy's "Healing Power", plus or minus 25% of that total.\[3]

Fairy Level Healing Interval Healing Power Level Chance\[4] 1 4.7 seconds 80% 33.66% 2 4.4 seconds 90% 45.00% 3 4.1 seconds 100% 13.75% 4 3.8 seconds 110% 5.16% 5 3.5 seconds 120% 2.44%

## Visual Style

The fairy may be one of eight possible visual styles, which are unrelated to its level and cannot be changed by the Anvil. The fairy style is determined based on the random number assigned to the save file and player slot (in Multiplayer games), meaning the player will always get the same fairy style in a particular save. The fairy sheds light in a radius of about 1 tile.

Although they share a similar sprite, all fairy companions are visually distinct from the crop fairy.
