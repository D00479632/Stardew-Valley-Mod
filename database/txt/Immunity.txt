Immunity is a statistic that affects your chance to be afflicted with any debuff. It has no effect on the length of time that you are invulnerable after getting damaged.
Each point of Immunity reduces the probability of being debuffed by 9.1%, additively.[1] For example, when wearing the Genie Shoes, which provides 6 points of Immunity, the chance of being debuffed is reduced by 55%. If wearing equipment that provide sufficient total Immunity (+11 or more), the player can stay completely free from any debuffs.
