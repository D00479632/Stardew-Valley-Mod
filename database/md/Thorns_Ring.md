The **Thorns Ring** is a ring that can be crafted after earning the recipe at Combat Level 7. The ingredients are 50 Bone Fragments, 50 Stone, and 1 Gold Bar.

While wearing the Thorns Ring, being hit results in the offending monster taking damage equal to the unmitigated damage of their attack minus the defense of the monster. The damage is doubled if the player has two Thorns Rings equipped.\[1] If the player kills a monster using the Thorns Ring, the monster will still drop loot like normal.
