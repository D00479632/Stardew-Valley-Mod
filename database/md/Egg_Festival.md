From Stardew Valley Wiki

The **Egg Festival** is the first festival of the year, taking place on the 13th of every Spring in Pelican Town Square. Like other festivals, the event lasts for most of the day and consists of two parts: a social portion and an Egg Hunt activity to finish the day. To take part, enter Pelican Town Square between 9am and 2pm. (It is impossible to enter the town before 9am; attempting to enter will say that the event is still being set up.) The festival will end immediately after the Egg Hunt or if the player leaves the Town, returning them to The Farm at 10pm.

Firstly, the villagers will be gathered in the town square and the player can socialize with them. There is also a booth set up where the player can purchase decorative items and Strawberry Seeds. Planting the seeds by the 16th allows Strawberries to be harvested twice before Summer. Talking to Mayor Lewis will proceed to the second portion of the event, which in turn leads to the end of the day; it will not be possible to talk to anyone or buy items afterwards, so finish everything first.

Secondly, the featured attraction of the festival is the Egg Hunt. The player and some other villagers will have 50 seconds to search for small colored eggs hidden around Pelican Town. The amount of eggs required to win is dependent on the number of players currently in the game. In a solo game (or with only 1 player online in a multiplayer game), the player must gather 9 colored eggs, or else Abigail will win. With 2 players, 6 eggs are required to win, 5 eggs with 3 players, or 4 eggs with 4 or more players.\[1] If the player wins, they will receive a Straw Hat as a reward. If the player has already won an Egg Hunt in previous years, they will receive a Prize Ticket. In a Multiplayer game, if two or more players find enough eggs to win, then only the player with the highest number of eggs gets the prize. If 2 or more players tie, then all winning players get the prize.

Note that the layout of the festival and the placement of eggs is different on even years, compared to odd years.
