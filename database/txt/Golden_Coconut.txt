Golden Coconut
This is one tough nut to crack, but a professional might be able to break it open.
Information
Source Foraging • Island Trader • Blue Discus Fish Pond
Location Ginger Island
Season  All
Sell Price Cannot be sold
The Golden Coconut is found throughout Ginger Island and can be obtained by shaking Palm Trees (10% chance when there is a coconut visible),[1] digging Artifact Spots on Ginger Island, or from a Blue Discus Fish Pond with a population of at least 9.
It can also be purchased from the Island Trader for 10 Coconuts after previously finding and cracking at least one golden coconut.
Golden Coconuts can be cracked by Clint in the Blacksmith shop for 25g, similar to Geodes. However, unlike Geodes, they cannot be broken open using a Geode Crusher.

The Golden Coconut is used in the spool of the Sewing Machine to create the Island Bikini. It can be used in dyeing, serving as a yellow dye at the dye pots, located in Emily's and Haley's house, 2 Willow Lane.

The player can skip having to forage by buying 10 Coconuts from the Oasis on Mondays, then trading them with the Island Trader for 1 Golden Coconut.
