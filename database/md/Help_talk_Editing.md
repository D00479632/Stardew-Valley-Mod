## Question

If this is suppose to be a policy page on the basis of editing, why is the page left unprotected? -- PanchamBro (talk • contributions) 16:44, 3 July 2022 (UTC)

Fixed; thanks for pointing that out. margotbean (talk) 13:20, 4 July 2022 (UTC)

Also what do you mean by "external links facilitate translation"? Interwiki links seem perfectly fine to use tho. -- PanchamBro (talk • contributions) 17:34, 4 July 2022 (UTC)

Translators stumble over mediawiki syntax on a daily basis. Having external links seems to be less of a problem for them to interpret. margotbean (talk) 15:19, 5 July 2022 (UTC)

I really don't think this is a problem. The `wikipedia` interwiki link is simple enough to use. In fact, I think it's more than possible to just create a template to create Wikipedia links if that's the issue. We use a template on Nookipedia called Template:Wp that gives ease to add interwiki links to Wikipedia.

If it's still that hard to implement though, I'd be happy to assist with implementing interwiki links. -- PanchamBro (talk • contributions) 12:24, 6 July 2022 (UTC)

I will keep that in mind, however, this isn't something we're looking to implement at this time. margotbean (talk) 14:31, 6 July 2022 (UTC)

## Game image assets

I was wondering what other editors use as setup to extract and upload game assets. I've read Modding:Editing\_XNB\_files and installed SMAPI and StardewXnbHack, but what tools do you guys use to extract the assets from the files? I'm having difficulty selecting subsections and keeping the quality up. For instance, some icons I can only get 16x16px while the uploads here all have 48x48. Any tips?

## New user

When are you "no longer considered a new user"? I want to redirect pages that don't exist (e.g. "Arcade") to pages that do (e.g. "The\_Stardrop\_Saloon#Arcade"), but I am blocked from doing so, with no documentation on when this restriction will be removed from my account. Quisido (talk) 20:43, 28 January 2025 (UTC)

New user restricions exist to combat spam and vandalism, so publishing the details of how to bypass them would defeat their purpose.

The wiki discourages unnecessary redirects because they confuse translators, especially when editors link to the redirect page instead of directly to the source page. Thanks for your inquiry! margotbean (talk) 12:54, 29 January 2025 (UTC)
