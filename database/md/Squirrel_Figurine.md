Squirrel Figurine Can be placed as decoration. Information Source(s) Fishing Sell Price Cannot be sold

The **Squirrel Figurine** is a decorative piece of furniture. It can be obtained by fishing in the northernmost section of the river on Ginger Island.

The required river section to the northwest of the Dig Site can be accessed by entering the Volcano Dungeon and using the Watering Can to create a path through the lava river to the secondary exit on the far left side. The first time fishing there has a 100% chance of obtaining the figurine (90% if the Dig Site bridge is repaired). Afterwards, each cast gives a 10% chance to obtain another figurine (9% if the Dig Site bridge is repaired).\[1]
