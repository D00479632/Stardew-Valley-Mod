## Penny's Schedule

Hello Willblue18! Regarding Penny's schedule: her schedule file specifies that she leaves home at 9am to go to the museum on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. The time she actually exits the home can vary, depending on whether players have purchased the "Community Upgrade" and whether or not there are obstacles in her path. So, the wiki generally lists the time the villager begins to leave one location for another, rather than the time they arrive at the destination.

If you check her Fall schedule, it lists 9am there, and her Spring schedule is the same as Fall (at least for those 3 days).

Hope this helps clear things up. If you have any further questions or concerns, you can always leave a comment on my talk page. Thanks, margotbean (talk) 15:42, 19 November 2022 (UTC)
