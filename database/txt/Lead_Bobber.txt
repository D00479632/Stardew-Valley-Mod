Lead Bobber
Adds weight to your "fishing bar", preventing it from bouncing along the bottom.
Information
Source Fish Shop • Traveling Cart
Sell Price 150g
The Lead Bobber is a tackle that helps fishing by preventing the bar from bouncing. It can be purchased from Willy's Fish Shop for 200g after reaching Fishing level 6. It may also randomly appear at the Traveling Cart for 450–1,000g. It is one of two fishing tackle that cannot be crafted, along with the Curiosity Lure.
Using two Lead Bobbers on an Advanced Iridium Rod prevents the fishing bar from bouncing even more compared to using one.
Only the Iridium Rod or the Advanced Iridium Rod can equip tackle. The Iridium Rod can only attach one tackle at a time, while the Advanced Iridium Rod can attach two. To attach tackle, left-click on the tackle, then right-click on the rod. To remove tackle, first right-click to remove any bait, then right-click to remove the tackle. For an Advanced Iridium Rod, the left tackle will be the first one removed.
Tackle does not stack in inventory or chests; each tackle takes up one inventory slot.
