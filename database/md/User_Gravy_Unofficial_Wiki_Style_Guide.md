This is an unofficial, unendorsed, partial/incomplete style guide using moderators' (specifically Margotbean's) edits as reference (as well as some regular MediaWiki syntax), made primarily for personal reference.

Goal Syntax Reference a game asset file. `See <samp>AssetFileName.xnb</samp> in the game files.` Sign a talk page post. `--~~~~`. This will generate a link and timestamp, e.g. `--Gravy (talk) 23:25, 11 February 2024 (UTC)`. Escape MediaWiki syntax (to demonstrate how to do something). `<nowiki>...</nowiki>` Link to a user. `[[User:username]]` for `User:Gravy`, `[[User:username|]]` for `Gravy` (note the pipe `|` at the end of the second example). Correct capitalisation of wiki links. When using `[[Link Body|Link text]]` or `[[Link Body]]`, the link body should be capitalised in the same way as the page it’s linking to. Link text (if there is any) ideally should be capitalised to match the sentence, but **existing links which are not causing confusion should just be left alone to avoid spamming with unnecessary edits.** Fix vandalism. Do if you want by undoing the edits. A moderator may sometimes undo your undo and roll back the vandalism themselves with more powerful mod tools if they feel that it’s necessary.\[1]
