From Stardew Valley Wiki

Hello there! I am Nikodem123fort, a new member here. I try to help with some pages and small edits (failing 99% of the time, I'm not good at making these things). I'm pretty good at Stardew Valley I guess. If you need me for anything (since I know like pretty much everything about stardew valley) then say it on my talk page.
