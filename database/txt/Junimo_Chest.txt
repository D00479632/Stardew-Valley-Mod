Junimo Chest
Through the power of forest magic, every Junimo Chest links to the same stash.

Qi Gem (30)
Sell Price Cannot be sold
Junimo Chests are purchasable storage items that function similarly to chests, although instead of maintaining an individually managed inventory, all Junimo Chests share one global inventory of nine spaces. Any item(s) placed in one Junimo Chest can be accessed by the player from any other Junimo Chest.
They can be purchased from Qi's Walnut Room. The first two chests can be purchased for 30. After buying the first two, additional chests can be purchased for 15 each.
Much like regular chests, Junimo Chests must be empty to be removed, and can be placed in many different places throughout the Stardew world. However, if a Junimo Chest is left in the walking pathway of a villager it will be moved out of the way.
Unlike regular chests, items placed inside a Junimo Chest will not be available for crafting when using a Workbench placed next to it. Junimo Chests may not be placed in the Skull Caverns or Mines.
History
