## Behavior

Blue Squids will intermittently "swim" through walls towards the player, dealing damage on each hit, or may just stay still. There are many in their levels, meaning that they can easily swarm the player if they are not equipped with a strong enough weapon. They may also charge up a special attack, shooting an orb that will apply the Weakness debuff, reducing the player's attack temporarily by 20.

## Strategy

Stand at a distance such that when they swim forward, they stop before touching you, within your weapon's swing range. Then, after you hit them, stand your ground, since they can quickly swim back to where they were knocked back from. It's best to avoid dealing with more than 2 at once, especially if they're coming from all angles. Effective trinkets include the Ice Rod and the Frog Egg, which can help reduce getting overwhelmed by a swarm.
