## Tailoring

Common Mushroom is used in the spool of the Sewing Machine to create a Shirt. It can be used in dyeing, serving as an orange dye at the dye pots, located in Emily's and Haley's house, 2 Willow Lane.

This shirt is very likely a reference to the Super Mario game series, where the titular character Mario commonly eats mushrooms.

## Quests

- The Common Mushroom may be randomly requested in Fall at the "Help Wanted" board outside Pierre's General Store for a reward of data-sort-value="120"&gt;120g and 150 Friendship points.
- 2-3 Common Mushrooms may be requested by Bullhead, Largemouth Bass, or Woodskip in Fish Pond quests.

## Trivia

- Common Mushrooms are the only fall forageable that can be directly put into the Seed Maker.
