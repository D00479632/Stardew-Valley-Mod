A Magma Duggy is an enemy found in the Volcano Dungeon. 30 Duggies (any type) need to be killed for the Monster Eradication Goal at the Adventurer's Guild.
Behavior
Magma Duggies behave exactly like the Duggies. They can be found within dirt patches on the cave floor, attempting to pop up and attack the player. Magma Duggies can move and sense the player up to two tiles away.
Strategy
Attack the Magma Duggy once when it appears from behind, then keep moving. This prevents it from appearing directly under you and dealing unavoidable damage. Standing on the edge of a dirt patch and quickly stepping into the dirt and back to bait a duggy out is another good strategy to kill them. Damage can be negated by blocking with a sword.
