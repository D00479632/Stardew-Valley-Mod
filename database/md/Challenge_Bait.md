Challenge Bait A "perfect" catch yields triple the fish. However, each time a fish escapes the "fishing bar", the catch is reduced.

**Challenge Bait** is used to catch up to 3 fish at once. It reduces the delay before a nibble on a fishing rod by 62.5%, the same as with Wild Bait.\[1] It can be crafted after claiming Fishing Mastery. It can also be found in Golden Fishing Treasure Chests (7% chance).\[2]

The amount of fish that the player has on the line is displayed right outside of the mini-game display on the top-right. It starts at 3 and decreases by one each time the fish leaves the fishing bar. So 3 fish will be caught at once only if the player catches the fish perfectly. **The fish will escape if it leaves the fishing bar 3 times.**

Note that catching multiple fish does not grant additional fishing experience points. However, catching multiple fish while working on a fishing or special order quest counts all of them toward the required total.

Challenge Bait can be used to catch up to 3 of the same Legendary Fish.

Challenge Bait cannot be used with the Training Rod or the Bamboo Pole. Only the Fiberglass Rod, the Iridium Rod, and the Advanced Iridium Rod can use bait. Challenge bait can also technically be used in a Crab Pot, but it is no better than standard bait.
