Mail for Festivals
In the different Festival pages, like the Luau, Dance of the Moonlight Jellies, the Stardew Valley Fair, etc. The Mail sections are uploaded files instead of Wiki text, can we update it so it is Wiki text instead of files? It would make this a look better. 9000 (talk) 05:26, 30 January 2024 (UTC)
I would say yes, but there is one problem: The letters exist in 12 languages. You cannot remove the letter images in English only, you must remove them from all languages and replace them with quote text. Since you've previously said you play on console and don't have access to the data files, that would be impossible for you.
I will put it on my "to do" list, but with version 1.6 coming soon, my plate is already overflowing, so I wouldn't expect it to happen soon. If I've not done it by 2025, then please remind me again. margotbean (talk) 17:24, 30 January 2024 (UTC)
