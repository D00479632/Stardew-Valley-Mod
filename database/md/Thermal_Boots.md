**Thermal Boots** are a footwear item in Stardew Valley. They can be found as a special item on floors 41-79 of The Mines by killing special monsters or by breaking crates and barrels. They can also be found in Fishing Treasure Chests after reaching Fishing level 2. They are a possible reward for the chest on floor 50 of the Mines if "remixed" mine rewards are selected in the Advanced Options menu when starting a new game.
