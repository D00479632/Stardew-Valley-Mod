Version 1.6.3?
A history note was added almost 24 hours ago referring to a change in v1.6.3 but so far the version history page has no such listing. It currently ends with v1.6.2. So, is there a 1.6.3 coming, and was the behavior change in that revision, or in an earlier revision? Giles (talk) 19:57, 24 March 2024 (UTC)
Disclaimer: wasn't me who added it, I did read that ConcernedApe tweeted that "You can now access Clintâ€™s shop and geode service while your tool is being upgraded" will be included in an upcoming 1.6.3 patch.
I believe it was an official tweet from ConcernedApe, mentioning that it will be possible to purchase from the Blacksmith and process geodes (and now mystery boxes) while a tool is being upgraded. I think this comes in version 1.6.3. Brandon Echols (talk) 05:30, 26 March 2024 (UTC)
