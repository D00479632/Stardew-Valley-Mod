The **Poppy** is a flower that can be grown from Poppy Seeds in 7 days. Unlike all other flowers, Poppies are a universally hated gift; Penny, who loves Poppies, is the only exception.

If placed within proper range of a Bee House (5 squares in any cardinal direction), a Poppy will cause Poppy Honey to be produced, increasing the honey base value from data-sort-value="100"&gt;100g to data-sort-value="380"&gt;380g.

Poppies can be purchased from the Traveling Cart for data-sort-value="140"420–1,000g.
