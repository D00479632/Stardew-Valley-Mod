## Interior Layout

Inside the Adventurer's Guild building players can find Marlon manning the counter, offering weapons, boots and rings for sale. Gil is sitting in his rocking chair beside the fire, and just to the left of the fireplace is the monster eradication goal list.

Neither Marlon nor Gil accept gifts, gain friendship points, or have bedrooms for the player to enter. The back room of the guild is accessible only after slaying 1,000 monsters.\[1] In that room, there is a box containing the Mapping Cave Systems book.

## Monster Eradication Goals

A list of how many of certain types of monsters killed is stored on the wall to the right of Marlon's desk. When the allotted amount has been slain, Gil will give the player a reward. Previously earned rewards can be purchased from Marlon. If the player has a full inventory and cannot take the reward(s) from Gil, when they close the inventory they will be unable to retrieve the reward from him. If the inventory is full they can select the item in the dialog and drop it on the floor. It will remain on the floor while they sort out space in their inventory. Otherwise the player will have to purchase the item from Marlon.

## Item Recovery Service

The player can lose items if they collapse due to low health in the Mines, Quarry Mine, Skull Cavern or Volcano Dungeon. In that case they can speak to Marlon in the Adventurer's Guild to use the "Item Recovery Service", which will recover one of the lost items for a fee. The fee is equivalent to the sell price of the item or stack - recovering a non-saleable item is free. The item will be mailed to the player overnight. Only one item (or one stack) can be recovered; the rest are lost permanently after it's selected. The player can make their choice anytime until their next collapse due to low health, which will reset it to the new lost items.

If the player has completed the Monster Eradication Goal of killing 150 Magma Sprites, they will receive Marlon's phone number. This allows the player to use the Item Recovery Service from a Telephone.

If a player has obtained the power from the Mapping Cave Systems book, they will get a 50% discount on the recovery fee.
