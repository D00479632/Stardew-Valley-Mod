The **Hazelnut** is found via foraging throughout Stardew Valley in the Fall. It can also be grown from Fall Seeds. Shaking a Maple Tree from the 15th through 28th of Fall has a chance to cause a hazelnut to drop from the tree. Five Hazelnuts can be purchased from Kent's shop at the Desert Festival for data-sort-value="10"&gt; 10 Calico Eggs each. Hazelnut can also randomly be found in Garbage Cans during Fall.
