From Stardew Valley Wiki

**Monsters** are enemies found in the Mines, the Skull Cavern, the Quarry Mine, the Mutant Bug Lair, the Volcano Dungeon, and, optionally, on the Farm. Monsters can attack the Player and damage their health. When killed, monsters have a chance of dropping Monster Loot and other items. Killing monsters increases the player's combat skill.

## Monsters on the Farm

Monsters can appear at night on the Farm based on the "Spawn monsters on the farm" advanced option (enabled by default for the Wilderness Farm). It can also be toggled in-game by offering a Strange Bun to the Dark Shrine of Night Terrors in the Witch's Hut.

Monsters on the farm scale with the player's combat level, with higher levels spawning more difficult monsters and Wilderness Golems. Monsters killed on the farm grant combat XP (though only 1/3 of the standard amount of XP), and count towards monster eradication goals. However, they don't count towards quest and special order goals.

Slimes killed in a Slime Hutch don't provide XP or count towards eradication goals.

Regardless of whether monster spawning is enabled, each Truffle dug up by a Pig has a 0.2% chance of turning into a Truffle Crab.

## Dangerous Monsters

Monsters in the Mines and the Skull Cavern are more dangerous during the Danger in the Deep and Skull Cavern Invasion quests, or while the Shrine of Challenge is toggled on.

Dangerous monsters have unique sprites and stats. With few exceptions, their health, damage, and sometimes defense are higher, and their speed identical, when compared to their non-dangerous counterparts. Killing dangerous monsters earns the player the same amount of combat experience points as most of their non-dangerous counterparts.

The Putrid Ghost, Skeleton Mage, and Shadow Sniper feature unique debuffs.
