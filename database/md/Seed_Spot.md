*See also: Artifact Spot*

A **Seed Spot** is a tile that is guaranteed to provide 2-3 seeds when dug up with a Hoe (other tools do not work). Daily luck influences the number of seeds obtained.\[1] Seed Spots can be found in various tillable (but fallow) tiles on maps all over Stardew Valley (including Ginger Island). They have a 16.6% chance to spawn instead of Artifact Spots in certain locations.\[2]

When dug up, the provided seed depends on the current date.
