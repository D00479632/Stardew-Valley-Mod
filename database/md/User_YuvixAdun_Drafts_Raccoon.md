# Raccoon Requests draft

### Raccoon's Requests

The day after the stump is repaired, a raccoon moves in. Following this, he has a series of requests for items, each yielding rewards. The requested items often require the use of various Artisan Equipment, such as the Dehydrator, Fish Smoker, and Preserves Jar.

After completing a request, a new request will be made after 7 days, which is indicated by the appearance of his wife (and later on, children). Completing 8 requests will earn the player the Good Neighbors Achievement. The player can continue to complete additional requests for rewards afterwards. The items requested will always be related to and obtainable in the current season.
