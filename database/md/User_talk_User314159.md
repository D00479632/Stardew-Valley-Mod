## Clam

Hello User31459! Regarding the changes to Template:NavboxFish and the Clam pages, you are correct that the clam is not a fish in-game, and maybe shouldn't be in the navbox (and perhaps the fish navbox shouldn't be on the clam page). It's a gray area, since the clam can be caught in Crab Pots.

The reason I reverted your changes is two-fold: (1) Template changes need to be discussed first since templates are the same across 12 languages, so a change to one requires changes to up to 11 other templates; and (2) The clam is still categorized as "Spring Fish", "Summer Fish", "Fall Fish", etc. etc. (you can see the categories at the bottom of the Clam page). This is true in all languages that have a clam page.

So, while it's not incorrect to remove the clam from certain "Fish" areas of the wiki, it could be argued that it acts like a fish, and so should remain. That, and the cascading changes across the other languages are the reasons for changing your edits.

Thanks for your understanding and your devotion to the wiki! margotbean (talk) 19:12, 5 September 2021 (UTC)

## "Coat of many colors"

Heyo.

I am working on a project approved by margotbean, and would like some help undertaking this big task. The project is to add shortcuts from all items in-game that can be used to dye objects, to emily, haley, and their house. If you would like to help, please start on the list of items that serve as a orange dye in the sewing machine/dye pots. Thank you! Fnaticlyric560 (talk) 22:59, 7 September 2021 (UTC)

I thought to ask you when I saw you fixed my mistakes of placement of the tailoring section. Also no one else that I have asked has even responded. Fnaticlyric560 (talk) 23:07, 7 September 2021 (UTC)

## Day Cycle

Hey just wanted to say thanks a ton for copyediting! Techhead7890 (talk) 19:54, 13 September 2021 (UTC)

No problem! User314159 (talk) 23:11, 14 September 2021 (UTC)

## Subheadings

Hello again! I just wanted to remind you that when you change a page subheading, it's a good idea to check for what links to it, so those links won't be broken. Another option is to add a &lt;span&gt; tag to the heading with the old name, but that's messier when editors look under the hood, so to speak. Thanks again, margotbean (talk) 21:14, 14 September 2021 (UTC)

Got it, thanks! User314159 (talk) 23:11, 14 September 2021 (UTC)

## Greetings

Just wanted to say I've enjoyed seeing your editing here. Nice points, clarifications, observations. And about that user name: should I call you "pi"? Cheers. Giles (talk) 17:31, 16 September 2021 (UTC)

I know right? My brother pointed out the resemblence between the name and 3.1415926... (as in the didgits of pi!) Fnaticlyric560 (talk) 22:00, 16 September 2021 (UTC)

Thank you so much Giles! And yes, feel free to; the numbers in the username were intended just like that! User314159 (talk) 03:27, 19 September 2021 (UTC)

## Thanks for fixing stuff up!

Just wanted to write a quick thanks for fixing up Combat, I couldn't figure out what Margot was referring to by some levels and not all of them. And I've seen you on a number of other pages too, keep up the good work~! Techhead7890 (talk) 14:36, 29 September 2021 (UTC)

Thank you! Yeah, it was kind of ambiguous for what was written previously for Combat health points. User314159 (talk) 00:57, 30 September 2021 (UTC)

Yeah, the rate that you are goin' at, you're gonna be a freaking moderater or something. Keep at it! Fnaticlyric560 (talk) 01:44, 30 September 2021 (UTC)

## Good job

You have only been on the wiki a short time, and yet, you have been one of the most productive users I know! Have you been an editor on another wiki before this, or is this all just natural talent?!? Either way, if you keep it up, "We'll have the nicest Wiki on this side of the gem sea!"Â ;) Fnaticlyric560 (talk) 14:49, 19 October 2021 (UTC)

## Skull Cavern shaft chance

Would you be able to add a code reference for your recent edit to the Skull Cavern page, referring to the 20% chance for a shaft to spawn, and the lack of luck in the equation? It would be most appreciated! Thank you, margotbean (talk) 18:21, 8 November 2021 (UTC)

Will do. User314159 (talk) 00:53, 9 November 2021 (UTC)

## Animal Products Profitability

Hello Pi! My brain is fried, and I have a request. A user added some trivia about profitability to the Dinosaur Mayonnaise page, which I deleted because all the analysis is on the Animal Products Profitability page. I commented that we should probably add a link to that page on all affected animal products' pages, but I can't think of the best way. What I've come up with is:

1. Add a link at the top of the page saying "See also: Animal Products Profitability"
2. Add a "See Also" heading towards the bottom of the page and add the link there
3. Add an "Artisan Goods" section to the pages and link Animal Products Profitability there (this doesn't make sense for artisan goods like Mayonnaise, but does for Eggs, milk, etc.)

I don't love any of them, but maybe having the link somewhere is better than nowhere.

What do you think? Please advise, and thank you in advance, margotbean (talk) 16:38, 8 July 2022 (UTC)

Hello! I think the best option would be to put the link at the top of each page about the Animal Products Profitability page, unless it is already linked elsewhere on a page (like with the Dinosaur Egg page). Less people would notice the link if it was at the bottom of the page, so I don't think it should go there. We could technically also add an "Artisan Goods" section to each page that doesn't have it but that would require more effort (since we would also have to standardize the format with other artisan good pages to make the pages read the same). If you are okay with having the links at the top of the page, I would say we should do that. User314159 (talk) 18:48, 8 July 2022 (UTC)

## Fish Pond Probabilities

I understand and agree that all the Fish Pond tables should look the same. I think the current layout is unnecessarily confusing, though.

The Lionfish page is the first one that appeared to be confusing. How is "Nothing" an "item" that has 0% chance of being chosen have a 77%-5% chance? And why was is it not written lowest to highest as 5%-77% chance?

My thought was to update the tables to more clearly show the "buckets" of fish quantities which result in the probability of each item. Especially for Fish Ponds which have different "items" which are really just different quantities of the same item (such as Roe(1) and Roe(2)).

It seems better to have every bucket explicitly labeled. Yes, it creates more text, but it eliminates ambiguity and creates consistency (both in visual appearance and data).

At the end of the day, I'm not going to fight this if you or others like the way it is. I thought it would be helpful and would be willing to update all the fish tables when I'm home and can use my computer to do them all in one day, but I don't care enough about it to fight for it beyond this explanation.

Also, not sure if this is the proper place for this explanation. I didn't see a "Discussion" page for edits (at least on Mobile).

Cheers and hope you have a good day! AlchemyFarmer (talk) 18:15, 9 April 2024 (UTC)

It's in backwards order because 77% refers to the probability at population 1 and 5% refers to the probability at population 10. And "Nothing" is an item that has a 0% chance of being chosen *if the chance that an item is possible activates* (always 100% if it doesn't activate). See the Fish Pond produce section for more information. Also, I'm not the one making the decision on how the pages should look. Best to contact an admin with your proposed change. If they accept then you can edit it for all of the fish pages. User314159 (talk) 18:39, 9 April 2024 (UTC)

## Special Items History

Hi. Just saw your edit of 5 April 2024 in the History section, removing history for Wallet objects. Are you sure about doing that? The Wallet article is going away eventually, so whatever is going to be said about its objects will need to remain in this new article. The History section could be clarified a little to identify the early info as related to the objects that were once wallet items. I think the main thing is to retain anything that might remain useful to someone who is using an older version of the software. I'm not sure any more just how far back that goes. Giles (talk) 17:45, 10 April 2024 (UTC)

When things were added to the Wallet still does not concern the Special Items &amp; Powers section itself though. So until we actually merge the Wallet page into that one (probably only after 1.6 releases on all platforms), it's not correct to have them there. User314159 (talk) 18:48, 10 April 2024 (UTC)

## Regarding Casino tip change

Hi, this is regarding my reverted tip on Casino, from your quote: *Vending machine exchange is already mentioned in the second paragraph. I also don't know what keyboard shortcut thing you're referring to.* The keyboard "shortcut" I'm referring is the actual Y letter in your keyboard. If you are buying data-sort-value="100"&gt;100 from the vending machine for large purchases, such as the Rarecrow, it can be a very repetitive task to click the vending machine, drag your cursor to "Yes", drag you mouse again to the vending machine... I just figured out you can confirm the purchase pressing "Y" in your keyboard. I imagine a few people might use this tip, it's nothing major, but that was my intention. MiKau (talk) 21:08, 13 April 2024 (UTC)

That makes sense. Although please do specify the shortcut when including the tip. User314159 (talk) 21:15, 13 April 2024 (UTC)

## SquidFest "Art of Crabbing" Condition

Your edit to the SquidFest page saying you get "The Art of Crabbing" only if you haven't already read it is incorrect. I had read it (purchased from the Bookseller) and received the achievement for reading all books before participating in SquidFest, yet I still received the book on the first day of the festival, showing the white "thumbs up" meaning it had already been read. On the second day, I received the alternative reward, as expected. Agf (talk) 04:34, 20 April 2024 (UTC)

Thanks for clarifying. The game code says the condition is "alreadyGotCrabbingBook", which is why I changed it. But since you experienced something different, I changed it back. User314159 (talk) 06:16, 20 April 2024 (UTC)

## Volcano Dungeon Table

Hi! In your recent edit to Volcano Dungeon, I noticed that you moved the 'nothing' option from the crates table to the paragraph above. I had included it in the table for consistency with The Mines#Crates and Barrels and for clarity and ease of reading - info is much more likely to be missed if it is only in the text, not the table. I was wondering what your justification for moving it was? (not trying to nitpick and I appreciate all the other work you do here, I just don't get this change)

As an additional note, the percentages in the table are now incorrect; a crate has an 18.86% chance of containing a Dwarvish Sentry, but a *non-empty* crate has a 23% chance. Wikonimo (talk) 23:12, 27 May 2024 (UTC)

I removed it because it sounds weird for "Nothing" to count as an item. However, now that you mention the crates and barrels page for the mines and the fact that it's easier to miss if it's in the text, I'll add it back to be consistent. User314159 (talk) 23:15, 27 May 2024 (UTC)

I see, thanks! Wikonimo (talk) 23:32, 27 May 2024 (UTC)

## Fishing

I just wanted to extend a warm thank you for updating *all* fishing info on the wiki, since v1.5 and counting!! Fishing is not my favorite mechanic, so I appreciate the work you put into it all the more. The wiki would be in sad shape without your edits. Thank you!! margotbean (talk) 07:02, 12 June 2024 (UTC)

Thank you so much for this warm thanks. I greatly appreciate it! User314159 (talk) 19:55, 13 June 2024 (UTC)

## Octopus

Do you want to take a crack at rewriting Octopus#Strategy? Just a thought, the section seems out of date. Your choice, thanks! margotbean (talk) 14:28, 19 June 2024 (UTC)

Sure, I'll try to update the section to 1.6. User314159 (talk) 22:49, 19 June 2024 (UTC)

## ginger island jellies

Idk what im doing and must be misunderstanding something so I'll just tell you what happened. Today on the Nintendo Switch version of the game I was fishing with the training rod on Ginger Island West in an attempt to get River Jellies, but no matter where I fished, pond, ocean, upper sections of the river, all I caught were Sea Jellies, so I assumed this meant that Sea Jellies could also be caught in the Ginger Island West pond, but I still have yet to catch one there after spending four in-game days using a lucky lunch + ginger ale. Plenty of Sea Jellies though. So either Sea Jellies can also be caught here OR the river and pond on Ginger Island West are no longer freshwater. I do have both photos and screenshots and i think a video capture if necessary but again, i have no clue what I'm doing. Riverjelly (talk) 03:31, 10 November 2024 (UTC)

I second this. Because of 1.6's recent release on console, I have been on my quest to get the jellies. I have successfully caught Sea Jelly in the ocean, pond, and river of Ginger Island West, and I think it's worth considering there's a small inconsistency in the versions right now. If I'm understanding the game's files correctly, each body of water can only give one type of jelly, which means there's definitely something we're missing.
