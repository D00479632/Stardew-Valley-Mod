The **Warp Totem: Beach** is a Warp Totem that teleports the player to The Beach by selecting it in inventory and right-clicking. It can be crafted when the recipe becomes available at Foraging Level 6.

The Warp Totem: Beach can be used to bypass events occurring in town without triggering them, but if used while an event is happening at the beach, it will start the event.

Note that using a Warp Totem: Beach on the day of the Luau or Dance of the Moonlight Jellies before the festival starts will consume the totem, but will not transport the player to the beach.
