The **Goby** is a fish that can be caught at the bottom of the waterfalls in southern Cindersap Forest during any season. The waterfalls are located just east of the Abandoned House.

When fishing in the right area without using the Training Rod, there is a 15% chance to hook a Goby. This chance increases to 30% if using a Curiosity Lure. Unlike with other fish, the Locational Chance of the Goby is not multiplied by 66% if Goby Bait is used. Instead, its Locational Chance is increased by a static 20%. So the chance of hooking increases to 35-46% if using Goby Bait. These effects stack, so there is a 50-61% chance to hook a Goby with both a Curiosity Lure and Goby Bait.\[1]

## Tailoring

Goby can be used in the spool of the Sewing Machine to create the Fish Shirt. It can be used in dyeing, serving as an orange dye at the dye pots located in Emily's and Haley's house, 2 Willow Lane. It can also be used as a brown dye when used in the spool of the Sewing Machine with a dyeable clothing item in the feed.

## Fish Pond

Goby can be placed in a Fish Pond, where they will reproduce every 4 days. The initial pond capacity is 3 fish, but the capacity can be increased to 10 by completing three quests. The only possible output is orange Goby Roe.
