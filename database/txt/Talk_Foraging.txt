Spawning Mechanics
The discussion about spawning mechanics are either erroneous or (to my mind) misleading. The problem revolves around the numberOfSpawnedObjectsOnMap variable in the code, and how/when it is *reduced*.
This page suggests that, if you gather forageables (keeping it, say, at a maximum of 2), the variable is reduced, maximizing your chances of spawning new forageables.
This is actually incorrect: the variable is increased when new forageables are spawned, but it is *not* decreased by gathering. It is only the weekly reset on Sundays that resets this value to 0. It's quite possible this is a bug, but it is definitely true (provable true prediction).
Effectively: the cap of "6 forageables" is a *weekly* effect, not a daily one.
As a consequence, there is (nearly; only modulo the extremely unlikely event of collision, meaning a new forageable trying-but-failing to spawn on top of an old one) little value in gathering forageables before Saturday. --Unsigned comment by Mon (talk) 16:55, 11 January 2022
Bug for Forester Profession
Since the Forester Profession ends up making Trees drop 25% more Wood, prior to v1.4, the Profession used to say "Wood worth 50% more." even though the Wiki used and still says it to this day, that you would gain more every time you chop Wood, which was not true, when you sell Wood it would sell for more Money, we did not know if it applied to Hardwood or not, but it this was the case, nobody would choose this Profession because nobody sells Wood or Hardwood but you have to sell at least one of Wood and Hardwood as it's in the Shipping collection, you will have to sell these two items in order to achieve Perfection. This information might be found in the Version History page, you should check the page to find this. 9000 (talk) 8:53, 4 November 2023 (UTC)
Hello 9000. I understand that English is not your first language, but what you wrote is largely unintelligible. The wiki's description of the Forester profession is up-to-date, so I'm afraid I don't understand what the problem is. margotbean (talk) 17:55, 4 November 2023 (UTC)
OK, I've found and fixed the problem. Feel free to correct this kind of error when you find it in the future. margotbean (talk) 18:03, 4 November 2023 (UTC)

New Rand System: Spawning mechanics?
Does the new random number system in 1.6 alleviate the issue from note 3 about the new season and Sunday spawn checks comparing only the same locations? JabberwockySR (talk)
New Forage XP Source
The Green Rain spawns moss on trees, as well as shrubs and weeds. I got a Foraging level up while scything through these, so at least one of these provide some foraging XP. --Chaosstripe (talk) 23:05, 23 March 2024 (UTC)
Would the Foraging experience not come from collecting the Moss?. I know, Moss is a "resource", not a forageable, but scythes cannot gather forageables either. Did you scythe something else at the same time? Or pick up some forage another way? This is not straightforward. Giles (talk) 20:25, 24 March 2024 (UTC)
I noticed this as well. It gives you 15xp when you hit one of those big bushes with the scythe during the green rain. Claumarmi (talk) 17:08, 14 May 2024 (UTC)
Tree Fruit
I play on mobile and my fruit trees don't spawn iridium quality fruit. I have pomegranate, peach, orange, banana. This page states that Iridium quality, is applied to fruit from trees when someone has the botanist profession. I have that profession. Can anyone confirm this? Thanks
Surfersurfer (talk) 04:30, 29 December 2024 (UTC)
Fruit tree fruit isn't foraged and isn't included. I've corrected the page. Thanks! margotbean (talk) 06:01, 29 December 2024 (UTC)
Since there is a section for items that don't receive the Botanist-Iridium status, can the fruit tree disqualification be added to that section? 18:18, 30 December 2024 (UTC)Dec. 30th
Sorry about that. If it's not forage, is it farming? Its gotta belong to some profession. Surfersurfer (talk) 02:45, 27 January 2025 (UTC)
Grammar/concise edit
Under quality, can we please simplify a sentence?
"If given as a gift to an NPC who likes or loves it, a quality gift also provides a higher number of friendship points."
I won't say that I am any better in grammar but it sounds convoluted. Thanks Surfersurfer (talk) 02:52, 27 January 2025 (UTC)
The sentence may sound complicated alone, but when taken in context with the paragraph it's in, it makes complete sense. User314159 (talk) 07:31, 27 January 2025 (UTC)
I appreciate your feedback. I think it should be written like this:
"Quality forageables that are given to an NPC, who likes or loves it, will provide a greater number of friendship points." Surfersurfer (talk) 20:54, 27 January 2025 (UTC)
