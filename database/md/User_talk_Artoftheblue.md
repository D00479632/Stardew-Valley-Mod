## Templates

Hello Artoftheblue! I see that you're creating a new template, so I felt I should let you know that any template changes must be discussed before implementing them. This is because template changes (including adding new templates) must be carried out in 12 languages. You're free to experiment in your user space, but creating templates in the main namespace must be discussed first. Please see Help:Editing if you have any other questions. Thanks very much! margotbean (talk) 19:04, 6 December 2022 (UTC)
