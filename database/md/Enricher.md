An **Enricher** is a Sprinkler upgrade that automatically fertilizes tiles when seeds are planted. Fertilizer must be loaded into the Enricher *before* the seeds are planted for it to work.

Despite the fact that it is attached to a sprinkler, the enricher will automatically apply the loaded fertilizer as soon as seeds are planted within that sprinkler's normal range. There is no need for the sprinkler to water the tiles for the fertilizer to be applied.

Only one fertilizer type may be loaded into an enricher at a time. The player must load as many of that fertilizer type as they wish to have applied to the surrounding seeds (*e.g.,* an iridium sprinkler has a range of 24 plantable tiles, so the equipped enricher would need 24 of any given fertilizer loaded to cover the entire range of the sprinkler).

A sprinkler may not be equipped with both a Pressure Nozzle and an enricher at the same time.

## Tips

Because fertilizer never needs to be replaced in the Greenhouse, the enricher will have only one-time use there. Additionally, because fertilizer does not disappear when already applied to a tile with something planted on it, it has limited use for crops that continually produce (especially on Ginger Island where crops will not die due to season changes).
