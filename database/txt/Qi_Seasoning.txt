Sell Price 200g
Qi Seasoning can be purchased from Qi's Walnut Room once unlocked. The price is 10 Qi Seasoning for 10 Qi Gems.
Having Qi Seasoning in the Inventory, the refrigerator, or a Mini-Fridge will cause any dishes that the player cooks to become gold quality. The Qi Seasoning will be consumed on use.
Gold quality cooked dishes sell for 50% more than their normal quality counterparts, and recover 80% more health and energy when consumed. Gold quality dishes also give better buffs when eaten, adding +1 to the stats (excluding Speed buffs). The duration of the buffs are also increased by 50%.
