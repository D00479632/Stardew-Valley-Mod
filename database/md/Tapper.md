The **Tapper** is a type of Refining Equipment that can be placed on a tree to produce Maple Syrup, Oak Resin, Pine Tar, Sap, or Mystic Syrup. It can also be placed on a Mushroom Tree to produce different mushrooms. It can also be placed on a Green Rain Tree (Type 3) to produce Fiddlehead Ferns. Other types of Green Rain Tree cannot be tapped.

When a tree has a Tapper on it, the tree is unable to be directly shaken (by interacting with it). However, if the tree is moss-covered, it will be shaken when the player swings a scythe or weapon on the tree to remove the moss.

The Tapper can be removed from a tree by hitting it once with an axe or pickaxe. This leaves the Tapper intact and able to be reused. If the Tapper is on a tree when it is struck by lightning or hit by an exploding bomb, both the Tapper and its contents are destroyed.

During Winter, tappers placed on Maple Trees, Oak Trees, Pine Trees, Mahogany Trees, or Mystic Trees continue to produce; however since Mushroom Trees and Green Rain Trees (Type 3) turn to stumps in Winter, tappers placed on them produce nothing during that season.

The Tapper cannot be placed on Fruit Trees.

Three Tappers are the reward for completing the Forager's Bundle on the Bulletin Board (Remixed).
