### Six Hearts

Enter Demetrius' house while he and Robin are inside.

**Details**  You see Demetrius and Robin arguing. She asked him to get fruit, so he got tomatoes. She exclaims that tomatoes aren't what he should have thought of because they're not "real" fruit. He defends himself by saying that tomatoes are indeed a fruit and his mistake was reasonable. He asks you to choose whether tomatoes are fruits or vegetables. Your response will affect only his friendship with you, Robin's will be unaffected.

Really? I figured a farmer would know the correct answer...
