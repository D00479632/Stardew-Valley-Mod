The Iridium Sprinkler is a crafted item that waters the 24 adjacent tiles every morning (a 5x5 area). Only tilled tiles will be watered. The Iridium Sprinkler is unlocked at Farming level 9.
One Iridium Sprinkler can be purchased from Krobus for 10,000g every Friday. One to two Iridium Sprinklers may occasionally be found in treasure rooms in the Skull Cavern. An Iridium Sprinkler may also randomly be a reward from Mayor Lewis' Prize Machine, in exchange for a Prize Ticket.
A Torch can be placed on an Iridium Sprinkler to provide minimal lighting in the dark.
Sprinklers cannot be used to water Garden Pots or the pet's water bowl. Sprinklers cannot be placed on sand.
