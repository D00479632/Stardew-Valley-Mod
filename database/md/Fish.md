**Fish** can be caught in oceans, lakes, rivers, and certain underground locations. Most fish can be caught with a fishing pole. The others require Crab Pots to catch. Some fish spawn only at certain times of the day, during certain seasons, or during certain weather. Upon catching a fish, the name of the fish and its length are displayed. Players can keep track of how many fish they've caught and their record lengths in their Collections menu. Fish can be used as ingredients in cooking and are required to restore the Fish Tank in the Community Center.

While players can fish near any body of water, some places have lower rates of success. These areas are more likely to produce trash, most of which can be turned into useful items using the Recycling Machine which unlocks at Fishing level 4.

All fish can be caught regardless of weather, time, or season using Magic Bait.

## Fishing Mini-Game

The fishing mini-game

Whenever a fish is hooked, a minigame which allows the player to catch it is triggered. In this minigame, a fish-like icon moves up and down inside a vertical space. The player controls a green bar, which ascends while the left mouse button is pressed and drops while it's not. The green bar bounces when it reaches the bottom boundary of the minigame unless a Lead Bobber is equipped.

A catch meter increases while the fish is kept inside the green area and decreases while it's not. Once the catch meter is fulfilled, the fish is caught. The fish escapes if the meter becomes empty. If the player is using Challenge Bait, the fish will escape if it leaves the green area three times.

If the player catches a fish without letting it slip outside the green area once (or only letting it slip outside when catching a treasure chest with a Treasure Hunter tackle equipped), the catch is considered "perfect", and that word is displayed above the minigame. A perfect catch increases the fish quality provided the fish was at least silver quality initially: silver quality fish become gold quality and gold quality fish become iridium quality. It also increases fishing experience by a multiplicative factor of 2.4.

The minigame usually shows no information about what kind of fish has been hooked. The only exception is with legendary fish, which can be seen wearing an orange crown in the fishing minigame. The player can, however, deduce a fish type by observing its behavior, and by knowing the season, time, weather, and location when it was hooked. Players can also use the Sonar Bobber tackle to see a hooked fish's type.

Upon catching a fish, the name of the fish and its size are displayed. If the player got a new record length for the fish, an animation saying "New record!" is shown. If a player caught a specific fish species for the first time, an animation saying "First Catch!" is shown. Upon catching a legendary fish, a message saying "You've caught one of the legendary fish." is shown.

### Tutorial Catch

The first time the player hooks a fish, a tutorial will pop up explaining the controls of the fishing minigame. Only the following fish can be selected by the game for the first-catch tutorial: Pufferfish, Anchovy, Tuna, Sardine, Bream, Largemouth Bass, Smallmouth Bass, Rainbow Trout, Salmon, Walleye, Perch, Carp, Catfish, Pike, Sunfish, Red Mullet, Herring, Eel, Octopus, Red Snapper, and Squid. If the player hooks anything not on this list (Legendary Fish, Jelly, Trash, etc.), a Sunfish will be hooked instead for the tutorial. This can happen regardless of time, weather, season, or location.

For the tutorial catch, the progress bar does not decrease at all. Therefore, it is impossible for the fish to escape unless the player is using Challenge Bait or the player cancels out the fish. Each cast will count as a tutorial catch until the player catches their first fish.

### Behavior

There are 5 types of behavior that fish can have in the mini-game:

- **Mixed**: These fish use the basic movement pattern.
- **Smooth**: These fish have a more steady movement pattern.
- **Sinker**: These fish have a faster downwards acceleration.
- **Floater**: These fish have a faster upwards acceleration.
- **Dart**: These fish move more random with a \[2 x difficulty]% higher possible amplitude in both directions, moving erratically up and down the fishing bar.

These fish can be caught in the submarine ride at the Night Market during  Winter 15-17, while the market is open (5pm – 2am). They can also be caught regardless of weather, time, or season using Magic Bait in the southwest corner of The Beach.

In addition to the 3 fish listed above, Sea Cucumber, Super Cucumber, Octopus, and Seaweed can be caught in the submarine. There is also a 0.4% chance (0.9% if using a Curiosity Lure) of catching a Pearl.

### Legendary Fish

There are five fish in the game classified as "legendary". These fish are caught in specific places and have a high difficulty. These fish are shown wearing a crown during the fishing minigame. Legendary fish can only be caught once per save file, or once per player in Multiplayer.

The Lost Book named *Secrets of the Legendary Fish* contains the seasons and locations of the legendary fish.

The high difficulty of these fish makes catching them challenging. Higher fishing skills than required just to hook the fish may be necessary, especially from food bonuses (*e.g.,* from Seafoam Pudding). Having the Iridium Rod or Advanced Iridium Rod and using a Tackle such as the Trap Bobber or Cork Bobber can also help. Ultimately, catching these fish can depend more on luck than on good reactions. Simply try again and again until the fish doesn't move too fiercely.

It is impossible to catch these fish while Mr. Qi's Extended Family quest is active because the corresponding Legendary Fish II fish will be hooked instead.

### Legendary Fish II

There are five legendary fish II that can be caught during Qi's Extended Family quest. They are caught in the same locations (with season and weather requirements removed) and have the same difficulties as the older generation of fish. Note that the fishing bar is the standard fish bar and not distinctly marked as it is with the original legendary fish. In addition, unlike the original legendary fish, it is possible to catch these fish more than once, and they do not share the same experience multiplicative factor of 5.

It is impossible to catch them when the quest is not active. The percent chances of hooking these fish are the same as for the original legendaries. Catching these fish is not required to obtain the Master Angler achievement. However, at least four out of five of these must be caught to unlock all of the bobber styles at the Bobber Machine.

### Crab Pot Fish

Fish caught in crab pots are usually normal quality and are worth 5 fishing XP. Crab pot fish will be silver quality if Deluxe Bait is used. Only foraged fish can be of normal, silver, gold, or iridium quality and are affected by the Botanist profession bonus. Some are only catchable using a baited Crab Pot.

All of these creatures can be used as components in the Crab Pot bundle. Crabs drop from Rock Crabs (15%) and Lava Crabs (25%); Clams, Cockles, Mussels, and Oysters can be foraged on the Beach. Between beach foraging and Rock/Lava Crab loot it is possible to complete the Crab Pot bundle without the use of a crab pot. Baiting the rewarded crab pots, however, is only possible by reaching fishing level 2, viewing Linus' 4-Heart cutscene, or acquiring bait from a Fishing Treasure Chest.

Items gathered via foraging or from monster drops will not count towards the Fish collection nor assigned a catch length. They must be caught using a Crab Pot to count. Cockles, Oysters, and Mussels caught using a fishing pole on the Beach Farm will also count towards the collection.

While none of these items can be eaten directly, all crab pot fish can be used in cooking recipes that require a "fish" and some have specific recipes of their own. All Crab Pot fish can also be smoked, which makes them edible. Most catch of normal quality except Crab, Lobster, and Crayfish is worth less than data-sort-value="75"&gt;75g, making it more profitable to turn them into Sashimi rather than to sell these items.(This changes with the Fisher and Angler professions and the quality of foraged items.)\[1]

### Other Catchables

There are some non-junk items players can reel in while fishing. They do not trigger the fishing mini-game but are instead immediately picked up. Each gives 3 fishing XP when caught and is always standard quality.

All six are displayed in the Fish section of the collection tab and count towards the four fishing achievements.\[2] However, they are otherwise not considered to be a fish, and therefore cannot be sold to Willy at the Fish Shop, do not benefit from fish price bonuses, cannot be used in place of "Any Fish" in recipes, and cannot be put in a Bait Maker, Fish Smoker, or Fish Pond.

## When to turn fish into Sashimi

Below is a quick reference table showing when it is profitable to turn fish into Sashimi based on the quality of the fish. Fish that never make a profit when turned into Sashimi are not listed (*e.g.* Crab, Crayfish, Lobster, Legendary Fish). Fish whose sell price is data-sort-value="75"&gt;75g, the same as Sashimi, are also not listed.

Note: All fish are worth x2 more when smoked in the Fish Smoker, consider this when cooking for profit.
