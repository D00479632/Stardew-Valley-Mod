Return Scepter The golden handle quivers with raw potential. Hold this scepter to the sky and return home at will. Information Source Krobus for data-sort-value="2000000"&gt;2,000,000g Sell Price *Cannot be sold*

The **Return Scepter** is a non-consumable Warp Totem. It warps the Player directly outside of their Farmhouse.

It's purchasable from Krobus in the Sewers for data-sort-value="2000000"&gt;2,000,000g, making it the most expensive inventory item in the game and second most expensive item, only behind the Gold Clock. It functions similarly to the Warp Totem: Farm, but is not consumed when used and teleports the player to the Farmhouse door instead of the totem warp point.

## Destination

The player will be teleported to the door outside the Farmhouse, or to their own Cabin.
