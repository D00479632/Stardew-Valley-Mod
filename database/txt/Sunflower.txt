Sunflower
A common misconception is that the flower turns so it's always facing the sun.

The Sunflower is a flower crop that grows from Sunflower Seeds after 8 days.
Harvesting a sunflower will drop 1 Sunflower, and 0-2 Sunflower Seeds. There is an equal chance to get 0, 1, or 2 seeds, so the total seed drop averages the number of sunflowers harvested.

Multi-Seasonal Crop
Sunflowers may be planted in both Summer and Fall. There is no difference in their behavior in either season.
If a Sunflower plant (of any growth stage) is in the ground on the 28th of Summer, it will continue growing on the 1st of Fall as though nothing had changed. Fertilizer in the ground underneath a Sunflower plant on Summer 28 will not disappear on Fall 1.

Tailoring
Sunflower is used in the spool of the Sewing Machine with Cloth in the feed to create a dyeable Long Dress. It is a yellow dye when used in the spool of the Sewing Machine with a dyeable clothing item in the feed. It can be placed in the yellow dye pot at Emily's and Haley's house for use in dyeing.
Quests
Sunflower is not used in any quests.
Notes
If placed within proper range of a Bee House (5 squares in any cardinal direction), a Sunflower will cause the Honey produced to become more profitable.
Since both sunflowers and their seeds can be processed into oil using an Oil Maker, when processing sunflowers into oil it is more profitable to first process the crop into Sunflower Seeds using a Seed Maker. This will yield on average 2 seeds, producing on average 2 oil for 1 sunflower instead of only 1 oil.
Sunflowers only produce 5xp instead of 14xp, since the price of sunflower seeds, not the sunflowers themselves, is used for the xp calculation. (code reference Crop::harvest)
