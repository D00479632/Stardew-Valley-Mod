**White Algae** is an item which can be caught with a Fishing Pole during all seasons at any underground location (the Mines, the Sewers, the Mutant Bug Lair, or the Witch's Swamp).

White Algae can also be dropped by several Monsters: Grubs, Mutant Grubs, Flies, Mutant Flies, Bugs, and Red, Purple, Copper, and Iron Slimes. A Ghostfish Fish Pond may produce 5 White Algae when the population of the pond reaches 9.

White Algae is displayed in the Fish section of the collection tab, and counts towards the four fishing Achievements.\[1] However, it is otherwise not considered to be a fish, and therefore cannot be sold to Willy at the Fish Shop, does not benefit from fish price bonuses, cannot be used in place of "Any Fish" in recipes, and cannot be put in a Bait Maker, Fish Smoker, or Fish Pond.
