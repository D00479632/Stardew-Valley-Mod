I'd like to suggest a significant update to include "smoked fish" in the infobox for fish. However, Iâ€™m unsure how to proceed with this major change, especially considering that the benefits of smoked fish are affected by the Fisher/Angler and/or Artisan professions. Could someone guide me on the best way to implement this, or help with making this update? Thank you! TheLuckAGER (talk) 02:17, 16 April 2024 (UTC)

Hello Luckager! I appreciate your input, but the last major changes to this infobox required 3 months for me to clean up, and that was during a period of relatively low activity on the wiki. So, please be patient, and I will get to it sometime within the next 7 years. Thank you sincerely, margotbean (talk) 02:39, 16 April 2024 (UTC)

I would love to help create this new section, for now I only have this in mind: a table like this "Smoked fish - sell prices - base/fisher/angler - sell prices with the artisan profession - base/fisher/angler". Im not 100% familiar with mediawiki syntax yet (but I promise Im a fast learnear since im passionate about code as im passionate about fishing), but I made some tests to implement this table. The only problem is that I dont know if the sprites for the smoked fish are available or how/where to find them(currently im using the normal fish's image), and since updating the template page will change all of the fish pages, I dont know where to post my code for approval.

Your attention to detail is not convincing. Please see my last comment. margotbean (talk) 01:33, 17 April 2024 (UTC)
