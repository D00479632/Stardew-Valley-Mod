**Explosive Ammo** is a one-time use item that damages anything within its explosion radius. Unlike other explosive items, it must be used with a slingshot.

The Explosive Ammo crafting recipe is unlocked at Combat Level 8. For each time it's crafted, the player will get 5 pieces of Explosive Ammo. After the recipe is unlocked, it can be purchased from the Adventurer's Guild for data-sort-value="300"&gt;300g each.

To equip a slingshot with explosive ammo, select the ammo, then Right-Click on the slingshot.

Ammo will detonate when it hits an enemy, the wall of a cave, a ladder, or water. Otherwise, it will pass straight through other objects, such as rocks or plants.
