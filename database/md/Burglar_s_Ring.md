The **Burglar's Ring** is a ring that can be obtained as a reward from Gil at the Adventurer's Guild after completing the Monster Eradication Goal of killing 500 Dust Sprites. After that, it can be purchased from Marlon for data-sort-value="20000"&gt;20,000g.

With the Burglar's Ring equipped, Monsters will drop (on average) twice as much loot; the game will make two random rolls instead of one for each item in a monster's drop list. The effect **does not** stack with two Burglar's Rings equipped, but it does stack with the power from the Monster Compendium.

## Dyeing

It can be used in dyeing, serving as a green dye at the dye pots, located in Emily's and Haley's house, 2 Willow Lane.

## Tips

- This item makes it significantly easier to obtain the items required for Special Orders that require obtaining loot from monsters, namely *Fragments of the past* and *Juicy Bugs Wanted!*.

## Bugs

There are a number of items that do not have a double drop chance due to where they are added to the potential drops (in the constructor for the relevant monster in the game code). These items include:

- Prismatic Shards and Diamonds from any monster after reaching the bottom of the mines.
- Slime Eggs from Slimes.
- Iridium Ore and Iridium Bars from Purple Slimes.
- Algae Soup from Mutant Grubs.
- Specific drops from Wilderness Golems and Iridium Golems: Mixed Seeds (20%) and Omni Geode (5%) after reaching Combat level 5, Iridium Ore (1%) and Prismatic Shard (0.1%) after reaching Combat level 10.
- Iridium Bars from Iridium Golems.
- Qi Gems and Ginger from Stick Bugs.
- Gold Coins from any monster when the Parrot Egg is equipped.

## Trivia

- While wearing the Burglar's Ring does not affect the chances that a Big Slime in the Skull Cavern will contain a special item inside (Pink Cake, Qi Gem, or Galaxy Soul), the player will receive two copies of that item when killing it if they have the Burglar's Ring equipped.\[1]
- Wearing the Burglar's Ring in the Mines does not cause special monsters to drop special items twice.
- It is possible to obtain two Prismatic Jelly or Ectoplasm using this ring, although this has no effect on the Wizard's Special Order.
