Farmhouse

Closed: Never Address: The Farm

The **Farmhouse** is the player's permanent residence in Stardew Valley. Initially, it has only one small room that contains a single bed, a fireplace, an old TV (either a Budget TV or Floor TV), various decorations depending on what farm style was chosen, and a floor mat of varying design, which can all be changed and expanded later on. The outer footprint of the farmhouse is a 9×5 rectangle. The fireplace can be moved by left-clicking or turned on by right-clicking on it.

Flooring and Wallpaper can be changed using patterns bought from Pierre's or JojaMart, or fetched from a Catalogue. New furniture (including fireplaces) can be added at any time.

Upgrades can be purchased at the Carpenter's Shop. Each new room added when upgrading can have its own flooring and wallpaper patterns. You can also change the color of the exterior at the Carpenter's Shop.

Upon getting married or having Krobus move in as a roommate, the game automatically adds an extra room that is based on that character's style.
