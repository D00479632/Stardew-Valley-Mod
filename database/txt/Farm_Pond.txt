Farm Pond with Crab Pots
Farm Pond refers to any of the bodies of water found on the player's farm.
On all maps, Crab Pots may be placed in the Farm Pond and they will act as if placed in any other fresh water source. All ponds can also be used to refill Watering Cans and to irrigate Rice Shoots or Taro Tubers.
Below is a list of fish caught by fishing on the pond of each Farm Map[1]:
Standard Farm: only trash.
Riverland Farm:
70% of the time, town river fish, i.e., fish that are found in Pelican Town.
30% of the time, pond fish, i.e., fish that are found in the Cindersap Forest pond.
Forest Farm:
5% of the time (modified by daily Luck), Woodskip.
45% of the time, pond fish, i.e., fish that are found in the Cindersap Forest pond.
Otherwise, only trash.
On the Hilltop Farm:
50% of the time, forest river fish, i.e., fish that are found in the Cindersap Forest river.
50% of the time, only trash.
Wilderness Farm:
35% of the time, lake fish, i.e., fish that are found in The Mountain lake.
65% of the time, only trash.
Four Corners Farm:
The large pond in the southwest quadrant is similar to the Forest Farm pond: it provides a 50% chance to catch forest pond fish, i.e., fish that are found in the Cindersap Forest pond.
Only trash can be caught in the small ponds in the other three quadrants.
Beach Farm: only trash from either of the two ponds.
