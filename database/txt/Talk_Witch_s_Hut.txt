Why is the interior in the "Gallery" heading and not an "Interior" heading? Most of the houses have an interior heading? Blushock (talk) 06:22, 17 January 2023 (UTC)
I don't know; possibly because there's so much other information on the page compared to the villagers' homes, for example. You can change it if you wish. margotbean (talk) 07:50, 17 January 2023 (UTC)
