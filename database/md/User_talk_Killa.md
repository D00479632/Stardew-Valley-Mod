## Bug

Hello Killa, and welcome to the wiki! I have a question about the bug you reported on the Volcano Dungeon page. Basically, I don't understand how it works.

Is it a mobile bug that occurs when loading an emergency or backup save?

When you wrote "reentrance from the south entrance", which entrance did you mean? There are 2 exits/entrances to the forge (one to the last level of the volcano dungeon and one further to the left that goes to the start of the volcano dungeon).

Any further info. would be much appreciated! Thank you, margotbean (talk) 20:39, 14 January 2023 (UTC)
