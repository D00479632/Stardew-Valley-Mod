**Flooring** is an item that can be used to decorate the floor of the farmhouse, cabins, island farmhouse, sheds, and slime hutches. It is available from the catalogue and randomly sold at both Pierre's General Store and JojaMart.

Flooring is single-use, and does not stack. It covers the whole room it's placed in and can also be placed on hallway floors between rooms.
