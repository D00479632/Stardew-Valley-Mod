## Trivia

- It is possible to get three harvests from strawberry plants during Spring of year 1. This requires using Speed-Gro and planting on Spring 13, and the easiest way to do this is to complete the spring crops bundle; this requires planting cauliflower on Spring 1 as well as visiting the Community Center after the Egg Festival and before planting the strawberries.
