Haunted Skulls (dangerous) are a flying enemy found in the Mines after activating the Shrine of Challenge or during the Danger In The Deep quest. During the Desert Festival, they may spawn in the Skull Cavern if a certain Calico Statue effect is activated.
Behavior
They behave identically to their weaker counterpart the Haunted Skull. They may fly away from the player and change the direction of attack.
Strategy
The best weapon may be a regular sword swing (not a club or dagger), since its angle is large. If possible, move in a direction contrary to the Skull so a mob is all on one side of the player, and swing at them all at once.
History
1.5: Introduced.
1.6: Can spawn in Skull Cavern during Desert Festival.
