Rock Crabs (dangerous) are an enemy found in the Mines after activating the Shrine of Challenge or during the Danger In The Deep quest. 60 rock crabs (any type) need to be killed for the Monster Eradication Goal at the Adventurer's Guild.
Behavior
They disguise themselves as stones, sometimes surprising the player. When immobile, they are invulnerable to attack, though they can be hit with a pickaxe to knock them back, making them mobile again.
Strategy
Rock Crabs may be differentiated from rocks by striking them with a weapon. A Rock Crab will make a knocking sound and a zero damage indicator will pop up when hit with a weapon, while a rock will not.
The Rock Crab can only be dealt damage if it is mobile, and not hiding beneath its shell. Strike an immobile Rock Crab with a pickaxe to make it mobile again.
Striking a Rock Crab with a pickaxe enough times will knock the shell off of its back, and will cause it to flee. Alternatively, setting off a bomb near a Rock Crab can remove its shell, and will cause it to flee as well.
