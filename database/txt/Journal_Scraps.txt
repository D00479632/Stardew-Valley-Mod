A Journal Scrap
See also: Secret Notes
Journal Scraps are collectable pieces of a sailor's journal that can be found on Ginger Island. They contain clues about solving puzzles, collecting Golden Walnuts, and general information about the island.
They can be activated in the same way as Secret Notes, by selecting it in the top row of inventory and right-clicking (as if consuming food). This will add the scrap to the player's collection.
The Magnifying Glass is not needed to obtain or use Journal Scraps, although once found they are contained on the same collection page as Secret Notes.
Unlike Secret Notes, Journal Scraps are always found in order (i.e., the first journal scrap found will always be Journal Scrap #1, the second Journal Scrap #2, etc.).
Journal Scraps can be gifted, but they are all universally hated.

Finding Journal Scraps
Journal Scraps are found in the same way as Secret Notes, except that they are found on Ginger Island and cannot be found in Artifact Spots (or in Giant Crops, since Giant Crops cannot grow on Ginger Island). See this table for how journal scraps can be found.
