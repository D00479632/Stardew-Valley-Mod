The **Pomegranate Sapling** is a Fruit Tree sapling that takes 28 days to grow into a Pomegranate Tree, after which it will produce one fruit each day during the Fall. Like all Fruit Trees, it will produce fruit all year round if planted in the Greenhouse.

It can be purchased from Pierre's General Store and occasionally from the Traveling Cart. It may occasionally be found in treasure rooms in the Skull Cavern, or as the eighth prize from the Prize Machine in the Mayor's Manor. One Pomegranate Sapling may be received from opening a Mystery Box or Golden Mystery Box.
