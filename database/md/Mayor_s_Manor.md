## Interior

The interior of Lewis' home is simple, with an open concept kitchen that connects to his bedroom. Players must gain two hearts friendship before being able to enter Lewis' room.

On the left hand side of the house are four objects to interact with, offering several services to the Player. From left to right the following can be done:

### Prize Machine

*For a list of prizes, see Prize Ticket.*

A prize machine, located next to the Town Ledger, rewards various prizes in exchange for Prize Tickets. Prize Tickets are earned by completing Quests, Special Orders, the Stardew Valley Fair shop, and through repeated Egg Festival and Festival of Ice wins. When using the prize machine, the player can see how many Prize Tickets they currently have as well as the next three prizes to be dispensed. Claiming a prize gives the player the first prize in line and advances the remaining prizes forward by one space.

### Multiplayer Funds

Next to the prize machine is a "Town Ledger" that can be used to change between shared and separate funds in a Multiplayer game. This change happens overnight.

### Divorce

Another book is next to the "Town Ledger", it gives players have the option to divorce their spouses for data-sort-value="50000"&gt;50,000g. This book can also be used to evict a housemate (for free).

### Lost and Found

The Lost &amp; Found Box can be used to retrieve items donated to failed special orders, lost quest items and tools, items from offline players, hats from children that have been turned into doves, and items left behind in the Stardew Valley Fair grange display.

### Secret

Details Â  Placing a staircase in Lewis' bedroom gives access to a secret maze room with the Lucky Purple Shorts at the end. Attempting to pick up the shorts will spawn a cursed Lucky Purple Shorts that slowly attacks the player and is immune to attacks. This process is repeatable to obtain multiple shorts.
