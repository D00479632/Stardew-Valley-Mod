New v1.6 price
in v1.5, the price of this upgrade was 50,000g and 150 Hardwood. I scanned the release notes some time ago and saw that it had changed in v1.6, but I don't remember to what. But someone entered a change in this article. Most recently, someone changed it again - back to the v1.5 numbers - and the edit summary text clearly indicated that the intention was to upgrade them to v1.6. Would someone check out what the correct numbers are and make the change, please? Let's eliminate the confusion. :) Giles (talk) 22:55, 26 March 2024 (UTC)
1.6 price changes for house upgrades
I fully expected my new Meadowlands farm to need 100,000g and 150 hardwood for the level 2 upgrade, but was surprised that the cost in both gold and materials was cheaper. I think this change should be noted in the main section. I realize that the new version is only for PC/Steam players, so the entry doesn't need to be completely changed yet as the info is still relevant to console and mobile players.

Shipping bin cost error
Sorry if I am not doing this in the right place. This page says shipping bin costs 5000g and 25 hardwood. In my game right now (1.6 latest patch on PC, no mods) it actually costs 250g and 150 wood. Noting this here since I don't have edit access. Happylabs (talk) 07:52, 6 April 2024 (UTC)
Adding TTB/TTU column for buildables?
Should there be a column for the amount of days to build/days to upgrade the different buildables from Robin's shop? It would mean not having to click into each buildable's page to see its build time. Just an idea :)

Yes, I think that's a good idea! margotbean (talk) 19:31, 10 June 2024 (UTC)

Community Upgrade #2
Good evening. I am hesitant to do this, but I have a critique. I have found most people to be hostile when critiques are provided. Here I go! On the community Upgrade #2 notes, it says (several times) that a shortcut is too narrow for a horse or that the trail is impassible on a horse. I have tried most of those shortcuts and the one I tried have no problems with riding my horse. At the very least, I know that some of the ones that say, no horse are definitely incorrect. I'd like to change these inaccuracies or have them changed by someone. Thanks :) Surfersurfer (talk) 16:38, 28 December 2024 (UTC)
Some areas are accessible by horse on mobile, but not on any other device. A brief note stating which ones are accessible on mobile would be just fine. Please remember to sign your posts with 4 tildes. margotbean (talk) 19:49, 27 December 2024 (UTC)
Wow. The phone has features that console and PC players do not? That is a big surprise. Usually, it's the phone that is beneath the others. Does the fact that the phone is now on the same, main version, as the other devices change this? What I mean, is that, since the upgrades, maybe the horse can pass through on all systems.
Can you please help me understand how the phone is basically a modded PC copy (with the PC mouse cursor showing in the mobile game), while the PC has a space to go through but cant do it with a horse? Is it just pixel difference, and a hitbox of sorts?
Thanks :)

The issue was discovered rather by accident during the testing phase of v1.6. I don't know if it existed prior, but it exists now. I cannot help answer your question as to why, that would be a question for ConcernedApe. margotbean (talk) 18:54, 28 December 2024 (UTC)
Thanks Margot. If there is any conclusion, I am glad to have the ability to travel in the shortcuts with my boy. :) Surfersurfer (talk) 19:37, 28 December 2024 (UTC)
We definitely asked for the same on PC, but we got no reply. I'm glad you're appreciating the mobile version! :D Also, you can add those notes to the shortcuts that are accessible on mobile, on the page. üëç margotbean (talk) 21:21, 28 December 2024 (UTC)
Moving Greenhouse Removes Grass?
This is my first time doing anything on a wiki so forgive me if I do this wrong. But when moving the Greenhouse, the untillable grass tiles disappear, making them usable for farming. I have tried my best and can't find any record of this change on the wiki or in changelogs. I have only tried this on the Wilderness farm. Again, sorry if I did something wrong here TheRedPanda324 (talk) 17:11, 20 February 2025 (UTC)
Hello RedPanda! This sounds like a bug, but the developer(s) don't read the wiki to find bugs. Please report the bug on the forums: https://forums.stardewvalley.net/forums/help-bug-reports-non-modded.12/ Thanks! margotbean (talk) 18:54, 20 February 2025 (UTC)
