Iridium Golems are a unique enemy found on farms at night if the player selects the Wilderness Farm. When the player reaches Combat Level 9 or higher, they have a 50% chance to spawn. They'll scale in difficulty based on the player's combat level; as the player's level increases so will the monster's difficulty.

Behavior
They come out of the ground and wander aimlessly and slowly make their way to the player, damaging the player if they collide. Their behavior is the same as Stone Golems.
Strategy
Swinging at them with a sword is the most effective strategy.
Notes
The seed that can drop depends on the season and date the player slays the Golem.
