The **Iridium Scythe** is a tool that is obtained after claiming Farming Mastery.

The Iridium Scythe has the following benefits:

- Can harvest items grown on tilled soil within its swing range, including regular crops, those grown in Garden Pots, Spring Onions, and other forageables grown from Wild Seeds.
- Its radius is larger than the Golden Scythe\[1] and it is more likely to cut all grass in its radius.
- 100% chance per swipe to harvest hay from grass, up from 75%.\[2]
- Inflicts 20 damage, up from 13.\[1]

It is the most powerful version of the Scythe. It increases the effectiveness of the Scythe and Golden Scythe by a substantial amount and adds a purple hue.
