“ “I've been Mayor of Pelican Town for over twenty years! No one ever runs against me when it's time for an election. I like to think that it means I'm doing my job well. I like being Mayor.” — Lewis

**Lewis** is the mayor of Pelican Town. Along with Robin, he greets the player when they move to the Valley and explains a little bit about life on the farm. Lewis is known to have some sort of relations with Marnie, as the shorts he lost and brown suspenders are found in her bedroom. Furthermore, a note can be found in his bedroom in the lower left on a shelf under a coffee mug, believed to be from her. The note is signed "-M".

When a festival takes place, the player will receive a letter in their mailbox, usually from Lewis, that says where and when it takes place, as well as any additional requirements.

## Schedule

After the Beach Resort on Ginger Island is unlocked, Lewis may randomly spend the day there. After leaving the Island at 6pm, Lewis will immediately go home to bed. Lewis never visits the Resort on Festival days or his checkup day at Harvey's Clinic.

## Relationships

As nobody has challenged Lewis for his title of mayor in the twenty years he has held the position, he may have a good relationship with everyone living in Pelican Town. He was apparently good friends with the player's grandfather; if the player speaks to him while he is at The Stardrop Saloon, Lewis states that he will be having an extra drink in their grandfather's honor.

In parallel with his work as mayor, he is also involved in the Stardew Valley Agricultural Fund. He may send the player a letter that includes money from the fund "to help you continue your good work", such as using it to buy seeds.

He has never been married and has no family; all he lives for is being mayor. He sometimes questions if it was worth it.

Lewis is particularly good friends with Marnie, as shown in the "Mayor's Shorts" story quest. He can also sometimes be found inside Marnie's Ranch saying, "I'm just here to make sure all of Marnie's business needs are met." Additionally, his and Marnie's 6-heart event confirms that they are in a relationship, although he does not want the relationship to become public knowledge.

“ “Hi there, \[Player]! How're you doing today? If you see Marnie, tell her I say 'hi'.”

*6+ Hearts*

“ “I've never been married. I have no family. All I live for is to be Mayor. Is it worth it? ...\*sigh\*...”

**At Ginger Island**

“ “I'm impressed, \[Player]. You've really fixed up the place!”

“ “Vacation opportunities like this could really expand the local economy! I'd better not stay in the sun too long, or my moustache will dry out.”

“ “Hehe... look at this place! I don't know how you did it, but this little vacation spot is the talk of the town.”

“ “Hehe... Gus is really in his element.”

“ “Everyone aboard! We're heading back to the valley!”

**Events** 

**Egg Festival**

“ “Enjoying yourself, \[Player]?”

**Desert Festival**

“ “After a long, dark winter, this festival is a good way to revive everyone.”

“ “All of this is possible because you fixed up the bus, \[Player]. I can't thank you enough!”

*Spring 17th*

“ “Remember, today is the last day of the festival. We'll be back next year though.”

**Flower Dance**

“ “If you'd like to dance with the other young people, you'll need to find a partner.”

**The Luau**

“ “Look sharp! The governor's here for his annual visit. If you brought something for the potluck make sure and add it to the soup cauldron.”

**Dance of the Moonlight Jellies**

“ “Good evening, \[Player]. The Moonlight Jellies are close... I already saw one glowing in the distance. Once we launch the candle-boat they'll come up to the docks and say hello.”

**Stardew Valley Fair**

“ “Well \[Player], It's the big day... Our most important festival of the year, the 'Stardew Valley Fair'. If you'd like to participate by setting up a grange display, I've left an empty stand for you. Just let me know after you've set everything up so we can get to the judging.”

**Spirit's Eve**

“ “Good evening, \[Player]. Have you ventured into the haunted maze yet? It's quite spooky. That strange man who lives in the tower set it all up himself. He wouldn't let anyone near while he was working on it.”

**Festival of Ice**

“ “Welcome to the Festival of Ice! The highlight of today's festival is the ice fishing competition. We set up this 'frozen lake' and stocked it full of fish. Just let me know when you're ready to compete.”

**Night Market**

“ “You know, I've purchased some of my favorite items from this market...”

**Feast of the Winter Star**

“ “Today is a time to be thankful for this year's good fortune. Forget your worries for a day and relax!”

## Quests

- "Mayor's Shorts": Lewis will send the player a letter on the 3rd of Summer explaining that he lost his shorts and offers a reward to anyone who can find and return them to him *discreetly.* The player earns data-sort-value="750"&gt;750g and 1 Friendship heart for completing the quest.
  
  - If instead the player chooses to place the shorts in their Grange display during Fall, Mayor Lewis will instead be upset, calling it a "sick joke" and pay the player off with 750 Star Tokens, demanding they return his shorts the following day. However, the player can decide to keep them and repeat this the following year, without loss in friendship points.
  - If instead the player chooses to add the shorts as a "special ingredient" to the soup present at the Luau festival, a unique dialogue involving the Governor and Lewis transpires. This does not affect friendship with the Valley's Villagers.
- "Mayor's Need": Lewis will send the player a letter on the 21st of Summer in year 2 asking them to bring him a bottle of Truffle Oil. The reward is data-sort-value="750"&gt;750g and 1 Friendship heart.
- Lewis may request that the player slay a random number of Monsters or bring him a random item at the "Help Wanted" board outside Pierre's General Store. The reward for slaying monsters varies by the number and type of monster, but is always an amount of gold. The reward for completing an item delivery request is 3x the item's base value and 150 Friendship points.
- "Crop Order": On the Special Orders board in front of the Mayor's Manor, Lewis may randomly request that the player harvest and ship 100 season-dependent crops. The reward is gold equal to 50% of the sell price of the crop and a Mini-Shipping Bin.
