## Gifting tastes

Hello Starfarmer! I'm messaging you to let you know that large-scale changes should be discussed before being implemented. Every change on the English wiki affects 11 other language wikis, so the scope of the changes needs to be considered.

Foraging items, in general, are not universal tastes, which is why they're listed individually on multiple pages. Changing villagers' pages in English without changing Friendship, List of All Gifts, and possibly other pages isn't a great change to make, especially without discussion. So, unfortunately, I've had to revert the changes. Thank you for understanding, margotbean (talk) 17:11, 5 September 2023 (UTC)

Where can this change be discussed? I would definitely like to propose it, since as you can see on the versions I've published, it feels much clearer.

Foraged plants seem to be a category of their own, in the same way "Fish or Fruit are; and Leah, Harvey, and Linus' preferences broadly encompassing all Forage plants with only a handful of exceptions feels like it could be used to make the liked gift list much clearer. - Starfarmer (talk) 17:20, 5 September 2023 (UTC)

I think Talk:Friendship would be the best place. margotbean (talk) 22:11, 5 September 2023 (UTC)
