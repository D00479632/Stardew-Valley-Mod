## Signature

I've noticed a couple of your talk page edits are missing your signature, produced automatically with four successive tildes. Please include the four tildes after each talk page entry. New topics are generally entered in a new section also. Thanks. Giles (talk) 18:05, 22 March 2024 (UTC)

Thanks for the tip, I'm new to helping out and like to learn/improve! YuvixAdun (talk) 18:08, 22 March 2024 (UTC)

Glad to help. Note the colon at the beginning of the line, which creates a paragraph indent in the text. If you use "#" instead, it creates an indented bullet point for a bulleted list. It's common practice to increase indents as one goes in talk pages, to differentiate a reply from a comment above. Giles (talk) 20:47, 22 March 2024 (UTC)

Oh, just use the intended character multiple times for multiple levels of indentation. Giles (talk) 20:48, 22 March 2024 (UTC)

## Template:Price

Hello YuvixAdun! I just wanted to make sure you knew, I lifted the protection from Template:Price, and am very happy to accept your volunteering to change the template in all 12 languages. Whenever you have time.

Don't be afraid to make mistakes! Just be sure to clean them up before you decide you're done. And let me know if there's something you can't work out. Thank you again! margotbean (talk) 18:02, 26 March 2024 (UTC)

Looks like Maiken beat me to it! Next time I'll be the one fixing itÂ :) Know how-to now, thanks! YuvixAdun (talk) 19:11, 26 March 2024 (UTC)

I'm so sorry. I read over your message, so that's why I started updating it. ðŸ™ˆ Hope you aren't mad about it. --Maiken (talk) 19:31, 26 March 2024 (UTC)

Oh dear God, no, I'm not mad at all, I'm so grateful that I finally got through to someone! (And I'm not talking about the 503 gateway errors!) Thank you both! margotbean (talk) 19:36, 26 March 2024 (UTC)

All goodÂ :) YuvixAdun (talk) 20:46, 26 March 2024 (UTC)

is it possible to also put the normal price of the iten? so we can consult when the iten is in a good price or it's too pricey

Not entirely sure what you mean, could you be a bit more specific? YuvixAdun (talk) 07:57, 22 January 2025 (UTC)

## Shrooms table

Hi! I saw your draftsÂ :) Thanks for picking up where I left off! The red cell background to show negatives is a good touch.

I was intending to add the energy and health to the table like this page had. Here's the amounts of each I calculated:

- Common:114E / 51H
- Purple: 375E / 168H
- Chanterelle: 225E / 99H
- Morel: 60E / 27H

The Artisan sell price might also be nice to include, but for the sake of not overwhelming mobile users with a too-wide table, I'm not sure it's necessary. Carrotlord (talk) 12:43, 12 April 2024 (UTC)

Thanks man! Liked your idea a lot! I've decided to include the artisan sell price + increase like you said, since a lot of people have that one. Hope I get to finish it todayÂ :) YuvixAdun (talk) 12:50, 12 April 2024 (UTC)

Tysm! I'm certain lots of other players will get lots of use out of it :D I lost steam messing around with how to organize the data in a spreadsheet and ended up not finishing lol, so your effort's appreciated!
