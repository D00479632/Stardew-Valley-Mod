The **White Turban** is a hat that can be tailored using Cloth and a Sweet Gem Berry at the sewing machine inside Emily's house or the Sewing Machine received as a reward for the "Rock Rejuvenation" special order. It can also be obtained from treasure rooms in the Skull Cavern (≈3.85% chance).\[1] The hat can rarely be found in the Mines as a special item, from special monster drops or crates and barrels, during the 'Danger In The Deep' quest or after activating the Shrine of Challenge.\[2]
