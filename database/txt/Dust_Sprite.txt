Dust Sprites are an enemy found in the Mines in the frozen floors. Dust Sprites are a great source of coal, as it is one of their most common drops. 500 Dust Sprites (any type) need to be killed for the Monster Eradication Goal at the Adventurer's Guild.

Behavior
Dust Sprites are small creatures which often travel in packs. They bounce in place and chirp while inactive. If they spot the player, dust sprites will bound after them, causing damage upon collision. Occasionally, they will break a rock that is in their way.
Strategy
Simply hit them. Cornering them against a wall will keep them from being knocked out of range with repeated swinging or stabbing. Because of their bouncy behavior, it's easy for them to be closer than expected.
Respawning
Traveling to the entrance to the Mines will reset all floors. Repeatedly farming frozen levels of the Mines, then exiting the mines will allow for repeated farming of Dust Sprites.
History
1.0: Introduced.
1.1: Added Coffee Bean to drop table.
1.6: Clint's special order, Slay Monsters quests, and the cutscene at The Summit no longer incorrectly list Dust Sprites as "dust spirits". Players no longer earn Mining experience points for rocks broken by Dust Sprites.
