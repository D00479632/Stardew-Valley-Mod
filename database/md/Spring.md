From Stardew Valley Wiki

**Spring** is the season when players first begin the game. It's followed by Summer and preceded by Winter.

In Spring, the grass is green. Trees regain their leaves, and pink petals blow through the air on windy days. There is also a variety of crops, forageable items, and fish which appear only during this season. Salmonberry season lasts between the 15th-18th of Spring. When Spring starts, new logs, rocks, and grass patches will spawn on the farm, in Cindersap Forest, and Pelican Town.
