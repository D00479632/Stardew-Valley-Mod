The amount of Fire Quartz outputs
I'm not sure, but according to the code, the probability of the Fire Quartz yielding 15,16,17,18,19,20 refined quartz should be 1/6 each, and the expectation per 5 fire quartz will be 17.5 refined quartz. Since the textual explanation seems a bit confusing, maybe we could emphasize the fire quartz as another example on the page. 群星之尘 (talk) 18:34, 14 May 2024 (UTC)
Calculations
The current calculations are not very insightful as they consider each case individually. It would be more efficient to combine the cases considering we know the chances of each case happening:
On average, every two times the player uses the Heavy Furnace, exactly 11 bars will be produced, using 50 Ore and 6 Coal. With a regular Furnace, we would need to use 55 Ore and 11 Coal to make 11 Bars. Therefore, on average, 45% of the Coal is saved and 9% of the Ore is saved. User314159 (talk) 20:38, 7 June 2024 (UTC)
