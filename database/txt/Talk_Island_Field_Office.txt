I'd like to suggest an edit for this page as I've not fully tested the suggestion (I play casually).
For the island research survey, as of 1.6, you can answer both questions in a single day if the first answer is correct.
I discovered this on the 28/April/2024.
I've postponed making a direct edit as I do not know weather getting an incorrect answer disallows further attempts.
I'd appreciate a more experienced wiki user looking into this for confirmation and further testing.

Yes, the original wording was bad. The one survey answer restriction refers to per survey, not overall. User314159 (talk) 15:11, 29 April 2024 (UTC)
