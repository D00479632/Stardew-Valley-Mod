Ingredients
Rainbow Trout (1)
Green Algae (1)
Trout Soup is a cooked dish. It is prepared using either the kitchen inside an upgraded farmhouse or a Cookout Kit.
It can be purchased at Willy's Fish Shop for 250g and can randomly appear in Krobus' shop on Saturdays for 50g-500g, in The Stardrop Saloon's rotating stock for 200g, or at the Traveling Cart for 300–1,000g. It can also randomly be found in the Garbage Can outside the saloon. One Trout Soup may be received from opening a Mystery Box.
Note: this recipe is profitable without the Angler profession - as then it will always result in profit when using the lowest quality ingredients.
