Mining is the skill associated with breaking rocks, mainly in the Mines. Larger or more valuable rocks and nodes take more hits, and in some cases, require a stronger Pickaxe to break.

Mines Access
During the first four days of the game, the Mines are closed due to a landslide caused by the Joja Corporation. On Spring 5 in the first year, a letter will be received in the mail saying that Joja Corp. has cleared the landslide, and then the Mines are unlocked.
Mining Skill
Mining Skill is increased by breaking rocks or by reading the Mining Monthly or Book Of Stars. Each level adds +1 to Pickaxe proficiency.
Mining skill points are awarded when rocks are destroyed -- it doesn't matter if this is done by Pickaxe or Bombs. Rocks destroyed by Monsters grant no XP.

Experience Points
250 Mining XP is gained for reading a copy of the Mining Monthly or Book Of Stars.
Different rock types give different numbers of experience points. While generic rocks inside the Mines provide no experience bonus on their own, if coal is dropped, 5 experience points are awarded (except in the case of the two gray rocks pictured below). No other "extra" drops from breaking rocks inside the Mines award experience points.
Breaking open a meteor dropped on the Farm during a Meteorite event awards no experience.
Experience level is increased immediately upon breaking a rock/boulder/node, but the "level up" window doesn't appear until after going to sleep.
The Geologist profession gives the specific gem nodes a 50% chance of spawning an additional gem. If this happens, then the amount of experience gained for each node is reduced[1].

Diamond Nodes begin appearing at floor 50 in the Mines, at approximately .0020 chance (1 in 500) of appearing in place of a stone. For every floor after floor 50, frequency increases by .000016 per floor. This makes for a .0028 chance for Diamond Node to appear in place of a stone at floor 100 (1.4 in 500 or 7 in 2500), and ultimately a .003104 chance for a diamond node to appear in place of a stone at floor 119 (1.552 in 500 or 194 in 62500).
The chance for Gem Nodes to appear is very small, but is slightly increased by Mining Skill level and daily luck. The chance for Mystic Stones to appear is also increased by Mining Skill Level and daily luck.
Food
Certain cooked dishes will temporarily increase the player's mining level. Qi Seasoning can be applied to further increase the stat buff for dishes cooked by the player.

1.0 1.1 See GameLocation::breakStone in the game code.
↑ There are 2 different code sections to assign coal to a rock outside the Mines. One is breakStone, a chance of 5% * (1 + DailyLuck/2 + 0.005*MiningSkill) for a rock giving coal which does give the +5 bonus. The other is onStoneDestroyed, a 3.5% chance for a coal that doesn't give bonus XP. From a player's view, the game will randomly give 6 XP sometimes for coal-dropping rocks, and sometimes just 1 randomly. Prospector causes breakStone to roll twice for the coal drop (but the extra roll grants no XP), while doubling the chances for onStoneDestroyed to 7%.
