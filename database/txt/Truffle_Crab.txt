Behavior
They disguise themselves as Truffles, sometimes surprising the player. When immobile, they are invulnerable to attack. If a player gets within 1 tile of them, they will get up and run away.
Strategy
Although Truffle Crabs only move around once the player draws near, they can be differentiated at a distance from normal Truffles by moving the cursor over them. If the green "+" symbol () indicating a forageable item does not appear, then it is a Truffle Crab.
