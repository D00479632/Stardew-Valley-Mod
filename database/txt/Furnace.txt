Recipe Source Clint in cutscene after collecting 1+ Copper Ore
Ingredients
Stone (25)
Copper Ore (20)
The Furnace smelts ore into bars, which are used in several crafting recipes.
Clint gives the player the blueprint for the Furnace in a cutscene the morning after collecting at least 1 Copper Ore. Exit the farmhouse between 6am and 11:30am to trigger the cutscene. The Copper Ore can come from anywhere, including from a fishing treasure chest or from purchasing it from Clint directly.
If you have not yet met Clint when he comes to give you the blueprint, the meeting will count as an introduction.
One furnace is the reward for completing the Blacksmith's Bundle in the Boiler Room or Engineer's Bundle in the Boiler Room (Remixed).
The furnace will occasionally make the same sound as placing down wallpaper or flooring.
