The **Rare Seed** is a type of seed. A mature plant yields a Sweet Gem Berry.

One to five Rare Seeds can be purchased at the Traveling Cart for data-sort-value="1000"&gt;1,000g each during Spring and Summer. During any season, there is also a 1.26% chance that the merchant will be selling 1-5 Rare Seeds for data-sort-value="200"600–1,000g each. (It is possible for Rare Seeds to occupy two slots in the merchant's offerings in Spring and Summer). Rare Seeds can also be obtained by using the Seed Maker.

Despite the description stating that this seed "*takes all season to grow*", it takes only 24 days. If using fertilizer that speeds crop growth or having the Agriculturist Profession, it will take fewer days.

## Tips

- The Seed Maker creates an average of two seeds from one Sweet Gem Berry 97.5% of the time. Since a Sweet Gem Berry is worth at least data-sort-value="3000"&gt;3,000g, each Rare Seed produced from the Seed Maker is created at a cost of data-sort-value="1500"&gt;1,500g to data-sort-value="3000"&gt;3,000g depending on the quality of the input. This makes the maximum price of data-sort-value="1000"&gt;1,000g at the Traveling Cart a much better buy, even though the quantities offered there are limited.
- Rare Seeds bought from the Traveling Cart yield the highest per-day profit of any crop. But if rare seeds are farmed in quantity with seeds produced by a Seed Maker, per-day profits drop dramatically. Assuming the player gets an average of 1.975 seeds per equipment use, seeds made from regular quality Sweet Gem Berries yield profits at a minimum rate of only about data-sort-value="60.9"&gt;60.9g per day each. Using silver quality fruit for seeds, profits drop to about data-sort-value="45.3"&gt;45.3g per day each, still the highest of any crop. Using gold quality fruit for seeds, minimum profits are about data-sort-value="29.7"&gt;29.7g per day, less than a few other crops. These numbers are based on the value of new crops grown at regular quality, and can be raised significantly if they are fertilized and higher quality crops are received in return. This suggests that best results will usually be achieved by selling gold-quality crops as is, without making them into seeds, and using only lesser quality fruit for seeds and replanting.
