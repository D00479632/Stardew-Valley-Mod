## Flower Honey

Fully-grown flowers planted near the Bee House (including those grown in Garden Pots) will have an effect on the type of honey produced, increasing its sale price. Flowers are not consumed when a hive produces honey, and multiple hives can make honey from the same flower, so one flower can service a large number of hives. The honey type is determined when harvested, rather than when it becomes ready. If honey is left in a Bee House until a nearby flower has bloomed, it will be harvested as flower honey.

If no flowers are planted near the Bee House, or if a Bee House has produced flower honey, but the flower is harvested before the honey, the honey will become "Wild Honey," the least profitable Honey. Honey purchased from the Oasis or Traveling Cart, or deconstructed from a Warp Totem: Farm, is also called "Honey", and is also functionally identical to Wild Honey.

## Sell Prices

Flowers not listed below (*i.e.,* Crocus and Sweet Pea) do not influence the price of honey. Daffodil and Dandelion are classified as "Forage" not "Flower" in-game, so they do not influence the price of honey either.

The formula used to calculate the sale price of honey is `base honey sell price + (base flower sell price × 2)`.\[1]

## Artisan Goods

Honey may be placed in a Keg to produce Mead. Mead may be aged in Casks to increase its quality.

Note that the sell price of Mead does not change based on the type of Honey used. Several types of Flower Honey sell for more than Mead, making it more profitable to sell the Honey.

## Tailoring

Honey is used in the spool of the Sewing Machine to create the dyeable Simple Dress. It can be used in dyeing, serving as a yellow dye at the dye pots, located in Emily's and Haley's house, 2 Willow Lane.

## Quests

One Honey (of any type) may be requested by several fish in Fish Pond quests.

## Tips

It may prove advantageous to have only one slot free in inventory before gathering honey. The gathered honey will fill up the last inventory slot, preventing the accidental picking of flowers used to make flower honey.
