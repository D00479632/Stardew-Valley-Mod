Drops
I'm confused by the drops list in the infobox. There appears to be three different entries for truffle with different drop rates. I'm not sure if this is meant to show different qualities? I would change the icons but I'm not 100% sure. Scarecrow (talk) 19:52, 18 April 2024 (UTC)
Just realized it's probably how the game determines how many truffles are dropped. In which case it might be helpful to say in the article text that they usually drop 1-3 truffles. Scarecrow (talk) 19:54, 18 April 2024 (UTC)
