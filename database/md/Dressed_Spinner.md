The **Dressed Spinner** is a tackle that helps fishing by reducing maximum delay before a nibble by 7.5 seconds (15 seconds if the player is using an Advanced Iridium Rod with 2 Dressed Spinners). It can be crafted or purchased from Willy's Fish Shop for data-sort-value="1000"&gt;1,000g after reaching Fishing level 8. It can also be found in regular Fishing Treasure Chests (4% chance) after reaching Fishing level 6 and Golden Fishing Treasure Chests (9% chance).\[1] It may also randomly appear at the Traveling Cart for data-sort-value="500"1,500–2,500g or obtained as a gift from Willy at the Feast of the Winter Star. It can also be found in Mystery Boxes and Golden Mystery Boxes after reaching Fishing level 6.

One Dressed Spinner is the reward for completing the Lake Fish Bundle in the Fish Tank. One Dressed Spinner is also one of the rewards the player gets the first time they win the fishing competition at the Festival of Ice.

Only the Iridium Rod or the Advanced Iridium Rod can equip tackle. The Iridium Rod can only attach one tackle at a time, while the Advanced Iridium Rod can attach two. To attach tackle, left-click on the tackle, then right-click on the rod. To remove tackle, first right-click to remove any bait, then right-click to remove the tackle. For an Advanced Iridium Rod, the left tackle will be the first one removed.

Tackle does not stack in inventory or chests; each tackle takes up one inventory slot.
