The **Golden Spur** is a trinket item obtainable after claiming Combat Mastery. It can be obtained by slaying monsters or breaking crates and barrels in the Mines, Skull Cavern, or Quarry Mine. Drop chances from both methods are affected by daily luck and luck buffs, among other factors. The Burglar's Ring and Monster Compendium do not impact the chance to obtain it from monsters.\[1] There is also a ≈0.6% chance to obtain a Golden Spur from a treasure chest in the Skull Cavern.\[2]

While the Golden Spur is equipped in the trinket slot, the player gains a brief Speed (+1) buff each time they land a critical strike. The duration of the speed boost ranges from 5 to 10 seconds, and this time is determined to the second. Each of the six possible values is equally likely when it is dropped, and the duration can be changed if the trinket is re-forged on an Anvil.\[3]
