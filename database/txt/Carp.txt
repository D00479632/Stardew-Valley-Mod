Tailoring
Carp can be used in the spool of the Sewing Machine to create the Fishing Vest. It can be used in dyeing, serving as a yellow dye in the dye pots, located at Emily's and Haley's house 2 Willow Lane.
Fish Pond
Carp can be placed in a Fish Pond, where they will reproduce every day. The initial pond capacity is 3 fish, but the capacity can be increased to 10 by completing two quests. The only possible output is yellow Carp Roe.

Item Delivery: One carp may be randomly requested during Spring, Summer, or Fall at the "Help Wanted" board outside Pierre's General Store for a reward of 90g and 150 Friendship points.
Fishing: Demetrius or Willy may randomly request 1-5 carp during Spring, Summer, or Fall at the "Help Wanted" board outside Pierre's General Store for a reward of 30g per fish. (You get to keep the fish).
Two Carp may be requested by Dorado, Lingcod, or Pike in a Fish Pond quest to increase the capacity of the pond from 3 to 5.
Note
Carp are one of the easiest fish to catch, rarely moving past the 3rd bar on the fishing meter in the fishing mini-game, making it easy to get "Perfect" on its catches.
