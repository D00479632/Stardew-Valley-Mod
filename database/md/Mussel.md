The **Mussel** is a fish that can be caught using a Crab Pot in any saltwater body of water. It can also be foraged from the Beach, mined from a Mussel Node on the Ginger Island beach, gifted by a pet turtle with max friendship, or randomly found at the Traveling Cart for data-sort-value="30"100–1,000g. Like all fish caught from the crab pot, it cannot be eaten unless it is used in a Cooking recipe or smoked.

75 Mussels can be traded for a Mango Sapling at the Island Trader.

## Tailoring

Mussel can be used in the spool of the Sewing Machine to create the dyeable Sailor Shirt.

## Fish Pond

Mussels can be placed in a Fish Pond, where they will reproduce every day. The initial pond capacity is 3 fish, but the capacity can be increased to 10 by completing three quests. Typical output includes dark gray Mussel Roe, Seaweed, and various Trash items, but more valuable items are possible starting at population 5.
