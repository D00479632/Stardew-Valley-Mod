## Tailoring

Snail can be used in the spool of the Sewing Machine to create the Rain Coat. It can be used in dyeing, serving as a yellow dye at the dye pots, located in Emily's and Haley's house, 2 Willow Lane.

## Fish Pond

Snails can be placed in a Fish Pond, where they will reproduce every 2 days. The initial pond capacity is 3 fish, but the capacity can be increased to 10 by completing three quests. Typical output includes yellow Snail Roe, Green Algae, and various Trash items, but more valuable items are possible starting at population 5.
