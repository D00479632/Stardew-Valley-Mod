Carpenter's Shop

Open Hours: 9:00am to 5:00pm Closed: Tuesday, and at 4:00pm Friday Address: 24 Mountain Road Occupants:

Robin

Demetrius

Sebastian

Maru

The **Carpenter's Shop** is located in the Mountain area north of Pelican Town. Robin is the town carpenter and runs the shop, which is inside her home where she lives with Demetrius, Maru, and Sebastian. The shop is open most days from 9:00am to 5:00pm.

Robin sells wood, stone, and furniture. She can also upgrade the Farmhouse and construct new farm buildings. She will buy building-related Resources,\[1] namely Clay, Fiber, Hardwood, Stone, and Wood (all other Resources are purchased by the Blacksmith instead).

She will begin construction the day after buildings are purchased, but she does not work on festival days. Most construction projects are finished in 2 days (by the start of the second day after placing an order). During construction or upgrades, Robin may be unreachable for dialogue or gifting.

## Shop Closure

The house is accessible from 9:00am to 8:00pm every day, even when the shop is closed.

The shop is closed on Tuesdays (except when it rains), as Robin goes to Pierre's General Store to exercise with Caroline, Jodi, Emily, and Marnie. However, she walks past the sales counter at 9:40am on her way. It is possible to shop at that time by entering before then and use the counter just as she passes. Similarly, Robin returns home at 8:00pm, and it is possible to shop as she enters her home and passes the sales counter.

The shop closes at 4:00pm on Fridays, when Robin and Demetrius go to the Stardrop Saloon. By entering the house before 4:00pm and missing her during open hours, it is possible to still shop by catching her as she passes the sales counter on the way out, just as on Tuesday mornings.

The shop is always closed on Thursday, Summer 18, when Robin goes to Harvey's Clinic. She leaves the Clinic at 4pm to walk home, and passes the sales counter at approximately 5:50pm. It is possible to shop when she passes the sales counter.

The shop is also closed on all festival days. If she was still working on a job on the farm the day before, then these closures will delay the job completion by one day. However, Robin does work on regular Tuesdays when she already has a job lined up, so there is no delay in that case.

The shop is closed all day any day that she is working on a job on the Farm.

## Shop Inventory

In addition to Permanent Stock, which Robin has for sale every day, she has a rotating stock of Furniture that changes daily.

## Farm Buildings

*For the magical Buildings see Wizard's Tower*

Farm buildings have a variety of uses. Some are required to house Animals. Both Coops and Barns can be upgraded to house more/different animals. The player may build as many farm buildings as space allows, including multiple buildings of the same type. The construction time needed for each building is visible in the construction menu.

While attempting to place a building, whether buying or moving it, all placement indicator tiles must be free of obstructions and marked as green; obstructed tiles are red. Obstructions can include rocks, twigs, and weeds, as well as *any* player placed items such as torches or furniture. The only objects that do not block building placement are tree seeds, crafted flooring and paths, and artifact spots, but the items are destroyed in the process. Farm animals and the cat or dog obstruct building placement, but clicking to place the building on top of them moves them aside.

The buttons in the bottom-right of the Carpenter's Shop construction menu allow the player to paint, move, or demolish existing buildings. Starter farm buildings (including the Greenhouse and default Shipping Bin) can also be moved in the same construction menu at the Carpenter's Shop. Moving a building applies instantly and is free, requiring no construction time, gold, or resources other than the travel time to the Carpenter's Shop. The building's contents move along with the building, all as a unit; a building does not need to be empty in order to be moved.

Tip: Building a Silo before building a Coop or Barn allows Hay to be stockpiled before it's required to feed animals.

## House Upgrades

When upgrading the Farmhouse, the footprint of the building does not change, so no adjacent tiles are impacted. House upgrades add space inside the house as well as accessibility to the kitchen for cooking.

Farmhouse upgrades require three days to complete.

Image Name Description Cost

House Upgrade 1 Increase house size and adds a Kitchen. data-sort-value="10000"&gt;10,000g Wood (450)

House Upgrade 2 Adds two new rooms, one empty, and one with a crib and two single beds. This allows you to have two children. Both the kitchen and the bedroom are larger. Unlocks renovations and building/trim painting. data-sort-value="65000"&gt;65,000g Hardwood (100)

House Upgrade 3 Adds a cellar under the house, allowing access via the kitchen.

The cellar allows the player to craft and house Casks which can age specific products (*i.e.,* Cheese, Goat Cheese, Beer, Mead, Pale Ale, and Wine) to increase their quality and value.

The exterior appearance of the house remains identical.

## Painting

The farmhouse, stable, and some farm buildings can be painted at the Carpenter's Shop by selecting "Paint Buildings" under the construction menu. This action applies instantly and is free, requiring no construction time, gold, or resources.

- Sheds, barns, coops, and cabins must be fully upgraded to be painted.
- The farmhouse can only have its roof painted until the exterior is fully upgraded.

Shown below are the areas where buildings can be painted. Players can paint any combination of the "building" (red area), "trim" (blue/purple area), and/or "roof" (green area).

The usual color, saturation, and shading sliders apply, and colors can be saved and applied to other parts of the building (or other buildings). Clicking the dotted icon will restore the default colors.

- Default Farmhouse
- Farmhouse - First upgrade
- Farmhouse - Second Upgrade
- Big Shed
- Deluxe Coop
- Deluxe Barn
- Stable
- Log Cabin
- Stone Cabin
- Plank Cabin

## Community Upgrades

### Trailer

*See also: Trailer*

After fully upgrading the Farmhouse and completing the Community Center (or the Joja Warehouse), players are able to purchase a "Community Upgrade" at the Carpenter's Shop for data-sort-value="500000"&gt;500,000g and 950 Wood. Robin then builds a new house for Pam (and Penny, if the player is not married to Penny). This takes three days. Note that in a multiplayer game only the host player is able to purchase this upgrade.

### Town Shortcuts

After completing the community upgrade, the player may purchase for data-sort-value="300000"&gt;300,000g a second upgrade that creates shortcuts to help navigate the valley more quickly. This takes three days.

- From Cindersap Forest (next to Leah's cottage) to the Beach, an east/west path along the water passable on horseback. It is possible to take this path to the beach even at times that a festival is being set up in town, the only non-warping way to get there at those times.
- From the Mountains (southwest of the quarry bridge) to Town (north of JojaMart), a riverside path too narrow for a horse.
- From the Mountains (along the fence east of the Carpenter's Shop) to Town (north of JojaMart and across the river), a riverside path too narrow for a horse.
- From the Town (south of the museum) to the Beach (Between the Tide Pool trees), a narrow path hidden in foliage, impassable on horseback.
- From the Bus Stop (by the tunnel) to the Backwoods, a flight of steps passable on horseback.
- From the island in the Mountains to south of the Adventurer's Guild, a wood plank bridge too narrow for a horse.

*(It's possible to use the town-to-beach tide pool shortcut without ever fixing the bridge on the beach)*

Below is a list with before and after images of the shortcuts.

## Trivia

- The tiles of the kitchen are laid out in a chessboard pattern in white and gray. The southeast corner tile is always white. This means that the 42 kitchen tiles present after the first house upgrade swap colors during/after the second house upgrade.

## Bugs

- If the player talks to Robin the day before the first community upgrade is complete, she says the player's house will be finished tomorrow, even though she's building the house for Pam and Penny.
