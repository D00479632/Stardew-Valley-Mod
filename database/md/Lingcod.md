## Tailoring

Lingcod can be used in the spool of the Sewing Machine to create the Fishing Vest. It can be used in dyeing, serving as an orange dye at the dye pots, located in Emily's and Haley's house, 2 Willow Lane.

## Fish Pond

Lingcod can be placed in a Fish Pond, where they will reproduce every 3 days. The initial pond capacity is 3 fish, but the capacity can be increased to 10 by completing three quests. The primary output is dark brown Lingcod Roe, but Bug Meat is also possible starting at population 9.
