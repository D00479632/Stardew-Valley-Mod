The **Crimsonfish** is a fish that can be caught in the ocean at The Beach during Summer. It is one of the five Legendary Fish, so it can only be caught once per save file, or once per player in Multiplayer.

The special requirements necessary to hook a Crimsonfish are:\[1]

- Fishing level 5, either naturally or using Fishing Buffs.
- The player must be standing at the far east end of the beach, which can be reached after repairing the small bridge for 300 wood or purchasing the second community upgrade. Any location on the eastern pier works, as does any location on the shore east of the pier.
- The bobber must be located in water with a Fishing Zone of at least 3, *i.e.,* it must be at least four tiles away from any land (including the pier) in every direction.
  
  - The Crimsonfish can appear one tile closer to land (Zone=2) if the bobber lands in Bubbles.

When all of these requirements are met, each cast has an 18% chance of hooking a Crimsonfish (25% if using a Curiosity Lure).

Although the Crimsonfish cannot be hooked again after it is caught, it is possible to obtain multiple Crimsonfish (per player) by using Challenge Bait to catch it.

The Crimsonfish can be caught regardless of season using Magic Bait.
