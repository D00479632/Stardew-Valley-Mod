- Fall

**Grass** is a naturally-occurring dynamic resource on the player's farm. Many unconfined fields of grass can be found there at the start of the game. Each day, it is likely that existing grass will expand and grow into adjacent unoccupied tiles. And occasionally, grass spawns randomly on any unoccupied tile on the farm. The player can choose to plant a new tile with Grass Starter also, creating a fully grown patch of new grass. Grass continues to sprout and grow throughout the spring, summer, and fall seasons. In winter, it goes dormant until the next spring.

Grass can be cut using a scythe, sword, or dagger. If the player has built a Silo, each patch of grass cut with the basic Scythe has a 50% chance of producing Hay, which is automatically added to the contents of the silo. With a Golden Scythe, there's a 75% chance, and with an Iridium Scythe, there's a 100% chance. During winter, hay chances for all scythes are reduced by 67%.\[1] Once all the farm's silos are full, no more hay is produced or stored until there is available room. Cutting grass with a sword or dagger does not produce hay at any time.

Storing enough hay to feed all the farm's animals for all 28 days of winter can save money or extra labor, since cutting grass in winter produces less hay than in the growing seasons. No new grass grows in winter, so it could run out entirely. Hay can be purchased at Marnie's Ranch for data-sort-value="50"&gt;50g each. Marnie occasionally sends a gift of 30 hay in the mail, at any friendship level greater than 0 points.

## Blue Grass

Blue Grass

Blue Grass appears naturally on Meadowlands farms. A recipe for Blue Grass Starter can be purchased in Qi's Walnut Room for data-sort-value="40"&gt; 40, which allows Blue Grass to be placed on other farm types.

Animals eating Blue Grass gain twice as much friendship as from eating normal Grass (16 instead of 8).\[2] If successfully cut with a Scythe, Blue Grass will produce two pieces of hay, instead of the usual one.\[1]

Animals eat half the amount of tufts of Blue Grass compared to normal Grass (Coop animals 1 instead of 2 tufts, Barn animals 2 instead of 4 tufts).\[3]

## Tips

- Grass will only naturally spread to tillable soil tiles. It will not naturally spread on green, 'grassy' tiles.
- Most paths, fences, closed gates, or pieces of furniture (such as chests or braziers) prevent the spread of grass through the tile it occupies.
- It is possible to exploit this by sectioning off patches of grass in animal enclosures, preventing them from eating all the grass in the area. This allows the grass to regrow more quickly, stemming from the fenced-off source patch.
- Placing a fence on any type of grass will prevent Animals from eating it.
- Animals love Blue Grass, so it's helpful to keep some near your farm buildings.
  
  - Note that Blue Grass cannot be found on any Farm Maps except for the Meadowlands Farm.
