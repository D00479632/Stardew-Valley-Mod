Monster Musk is a crafted item used to encounter more monsters. The recipe is earned after completing the Wizard's Special Order "Prismatic Jelly". It can also be obtained by trading a Combat Quarterly with the Bookseller.
Monster Musk has a duration of 10 minutes. If any player has the Monster Musk buff, the number of enemies on a given floor of the Mines or Skull Cavern when entering the floor is doubled.[1] It doesn't have an effect in areas resetting at the end of the day like the Volcano Dungeon, the Quarry Mine or the Mutant Bug Lair. However, it will still affect the number of off map spawns.
It is a special-effect buff, meaning that using Monster Musk will not remove any buffs from consumed drinks or food, or vice-versa.
