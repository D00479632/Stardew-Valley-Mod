## Heart Events

### Anytime

At any friendship level greater than zero friendship points, you may receive a gift in the mail from Caroline. The chance of receiving a gift in the mail increases as your friendship with Caroline increases.

**Details** 

Item Description Cauliflower Parsnip Potato Dear (Name),

Here's a vegetable from the little garden I keep out back. You probably have more veggies than you know what to do with, but oh well.

-Caroline

### Two Hearts

Enter the sunroom via the door in Caroline's kitchen between 9am and 5pm on a day when it's not raining.

**Details** 

Sunroom interior

Caroline is excited to show you her new "private" sunroom. She asks what you think of it.

- **It's beautiful!** *(No effect on friendship.)*
- **It's very relaxing.** *(No effect on friendship.)*
- **It's too hot in here...** *(No effect on friendship.)*
- **Not as good as my farm!** *(No effect on friendship.)*

Caroline continues telling you how peaceful her sunroom sanctuary is, and offers you a cup of her home-grown Green Tea. You can choose "yes" or "no" without penalty. In either case, a surrealistic cutscene plays, after which Caroline says "Feel free to come here and relax any time you want, okay?"

The sunroom is then unlocked and can be visited any time the house is open. Inside is a Tea Bush that can be harvested to obtain Tea Leaves once each day, during the last week of any season.

The next day, Caroline sends a letter in the mail with the recipe to make Tea Saplings.

### Three Hearts

Caroline sends you a recipe in the mail.

**Details** 

Image Recipe Description

Parsnip Soup Nothing is more satisfying than cooking with fresh vegetables from your own garden! I've enclosed a recipe to help you out. Take care,

-Caroline

### Six Hearts

Enter Pierre's General Store when Caroline and Abigail are there.

**Details**  As you enter the store, you hear Caroline and Abigail having an argument in the kitchen.

- Abigail: "Stop telling me how to live my life!"
- Caroline: "Hey, cut it out! We're letting you live here free of charge until you finish school. It seems like you don't appreciate that at all!"
- Abigail: "Stop trying to make me feel guilty. I appreciate that you and Dad are helping me out, but expecting me to dress the way you want is ridiculous. I'm not a little girl anymore, Mom."
- Caroline: *(pause)* "...You're right. I'm sorry."

Abigail turns towards the door where you're hiding, and asks if someone is there. You run away, and Abigail swears the house is haunted. Abigail comes out, and says "Urgghh... Sorry... I was fighting with my Mom earlier."

### Seven Hearts

Caroline sends you a recipe in the mail.

**Details**  Note that the recipe is called **Vegetable Stew** in the letter, but cooking the recipe creates **Vegetable Medley**.

## Quotes

**Regular** 

**First Meeting**

“ “Hello! You must be \[Player], the new farmer. I'm Caroline. My husband runs the general store here. And have you met my daughter, Abigail? She's the pale one with the purple hair.”

**Regular**

“ “I wish Abby wouldn't spend so much time in her room.”

“ “I've seen wild horseradish in the forest. Foraging can be a fun way to earn some cash. Or you can use what you find as gifts or food.”

“ “Hi there. Do you have everything you need for the farm? If not, we might be able to help you out. We carry a variety of useful items.”

“ “Hmmm... I wonder if I can get Pierre to cook dinner tonight.”

“ “Hmmm... what am I going to make for dinner tonight? Maybe I'll just get take-out from the Saloon.”

“ “It's a fine-looking day. On days like this I like to help Evelyn with the public gardens. She's strong for her age, but I think she appreciates all the help she can get.”

“ “Is it just me, or does Abigail have an unhealthy interest in doom and gloom? Maybe I'm just too old to understand.”

“ “Abby's always had a strange interest in the occult. I'm not sure where she gets it from...”

“ “Today I'm just going to relax and think positively. Do you ever take a day off?”

*If sold low quality crops to Pierre*

“ “Oh, \[Player]... This is embarrassing. I threw one of your \[items] you sold us into my compost bin. Now the whole thing smells horrendous. Where did you find that thing again?”

*If sold high quality crops to Pierre*

“ “Oh, \[Player]... This is embarrassing. I threw one of your \[items] you sold us into my compost bin. But on the bright side, the worms are really loving it! They've never looked happier!”

*Player married to Abigail*

“ “Hi, \[Player]. Are you enjoying the married life? I hope so!”

“ “Dinner's been a lot quieter since Abigail moved out... No, not because she used to chew with her mouth open!”

“ “How's Abigail's health? She's always been such a pale girl. Hopefully the farm lifestyle puts a little color in her cheeks.”

“ “Abby was taking online classes here, but I don't think her heart was really in it... She's a free spirit, like I was before I met Pierre. She's probably having the time of her life on your farm.”

*6+ Hearts*

“ “Are you excited for the new year? I predict that you'll be super-successful on your farm.”

*8+ Hearts*

**Summer**

“ “On Wednesdays the shop is closed. Keep that in mind if you're going to need anything.”

“ “I've been seeing wild fruits in the forest lately. Foraging can be a fun way to earn some cash. Or you can use what you find as gifts or food.”

“ “Hi there. Do you have everything you need for the farm? If not, we might be able to help you out. We carry a variety of useful items.”

“ “Is it just me, or does Abigail look a little pale? Maybe I'm just worrying about her too much.”

“ “Time seems to go by faster and faster the older you get...”

**Rain**

“ “My garden is happy today.

...and our water bill will be lower this month.”

**Green Rain** *Year 1*

“ “I've never seen green rain before... It must not be too dangerous if you made it here!”

*Year 2+*

“ “You're looking really fit, Jodi! Those dumbbells do wonders, don't they?”

“ “Mmff... I think I've earned some cookies today. \*crunch\*.”

**Fridays Museum**

“ “Finally... A little time to myself.”

**Sundays when the townsfolk are using the altar room**

“ “It was the previous owners who built the altar room. We aren't religious, but we let the other townsfolk use it if they want.”

**At Ginger Island**

“ “Willy gave us each a piece of his fish jerky. I'm still chewing on it.”

“ “The water is so warm here compared to the valley. It's really pleasant!”
