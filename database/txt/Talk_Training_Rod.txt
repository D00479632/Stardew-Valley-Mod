Catching Woodskip with Training Rod
This page suggests that Woodskip cannot be caught with the Training Rod, as it has a fish difficulty of 50. However, this appears to be false, at least for the Forest Farm. I would post a YouTube link here, however the wiki will not let me. Lemoniscence (talk) 12:25, 18 August 2023 (UTC)lemoniscence
I could see the link in the abuse filter log, and I watched the video. I also dug into the code, and it doesn't seem possible. Did you enchant the Training Rod by any chance? (Is that even possible?) Were you using any mods? What platform (computer, Xbox, Playstation, etc.)?
The fishing code experts seem to have gone dormant, and I'm sorry I can't give you a reason for why you appear to have caught a Woodskip with a Training Rod. Perhaps someone more intimately familiar with GameLocation::getFish can explain. margotbean (talk) 14:16, 18 August 2023 (UTC)
Huh, that's odd. The rod isn't enchanted - I didn't even know enchantments were in this game, haha - and I'm on PC, using no mods here, not even SMAPI - though I have used cosmetic mods in the past if that matters.
Oh, by the way, it's not important to me that I don't have a reason - I just thought it was interesting it wasn't listed on the page. Lemoniscence (talk) 19:12, 18 August 2023 (UTC)lemoniscence
Confirmed, see Farm::getFish, the part that handles farm 2. Nice catch, Lemoniscence. (Also, just as trivia, there's another place this can happen - you can catch the lava eel with the training rod in level 100 of the mines) Atravita (talk) 20:29, 18 August 2023 (UTC)
Thank you both very much!! But, does that mean that any high difficulty fish from Cindersap Forest can be caught on the Forest Farm (Catfish, Dorado, Lingcod, Midnight Carp, Pike, Salmon, & Tiger Trout)? margotbean (talk) 23:57, 18 August 2023 (UTC)
Nope - the woodskip is hardcoded, which why it skips the training rod check.
Relevant code block
    if (Game1.whichFarm == 2)
    {
         if (Game1.random.NextDouble() < 0.05 + Game1.player.DailyLuck)
         {
              return new Object(734, 1); //woodskip
         }
         if (Game1.random.NextDouble() < 0.45)
         {
              // the other fish, which check training rod.
              return base.getFish(millisecondsAfterNibble, bait, waterDepth, who, baitPotency, bobberTile, "Forest");
         }
     }
As for the other fishies that are hardcoded....well, those are just the beach's forage-fish.
