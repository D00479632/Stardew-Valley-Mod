“ “Decorates the walls of one room.”

*For furniture, see Furniture.*

*For flooring, see Flooring.*

**Wallpaper** is an item that is sold at both Pierre's General Store for data-sort-value="200"&gt;200g and JojaMart for data-sort-value="250"&gt;250g. A new, randomly selected wallpaper is sold each day, from the selection of wallpapers available in the Catalogue (excluding the Greenhouse-styled wallpaper in the final position). Both shops sell the same random wallpaper on the same day.

Wallpapers are single-use and do not stack. They cover the whole room they're placed in and can also be placed on hallway walls between rooms. Wallpapers placed on hallways will only cover their upper area, unless the hallway has been turned into a room with an "open" renovation.

To place a wallpaper on a room, the character must be facing up by its wall. To place a wallpaper on a hallway, the character must be facing one of its sides from the adjacent rooms. In both cases, obstacles like decorations and equipment between the wall and the character can prevent placing the wallpaper.

## Catalogue Wallpapers

Most wallpapers can be obtained from Catalogues, furniture items which can be interacted with to obtain a selection of wallpaper, flooring, and/or furniture for data-sort-value="0"&gt;0g wherever the object is placed. The wallpaper selection offered in these catalogues is constant, and does not rotate. They do not have unique names, so the tables below list wallpapers available from each catalogue in the order they are shown in-game.
