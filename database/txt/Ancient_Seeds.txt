This article is about the fruit seed. For the artifact, see the Ancient Seed page.
Ancient Seeds are a type of seed. Mature plants yield Ancient Fruit. After donating an Ancient Seed artifact to the Museum, a packet of Ancient Seeds can be claimed from Gunther as a reward. A crafting recipe will also be given which allows Ancient Seeds to be crafted from an Ancient Seed artifact.
They can also be obtained from Ancient Fruit by using a Seed Maker. Whenever the Seed Maker is used with any crop other than Ancient Fruit, there is a 0.5% chance to obtain one packet of Ancient Seeds instead of the crop's seeds.
Ancient Seeds cannot be planted in Garden Pots. Attempting to place Ancient Seeds in a Garden Pot will display the message "Her roots grow very deep... She wouldn't be happy in there."
Ancient Seeds can be planted in the Greenhouse.
Ancient Seeds can be deconstructed to make an Ancient Seed artifact using a Deconstructor. This is useful if the player has a packet of Ancient Seeds available but does not yet have the artifact donated to the Museum.
