Ingredients Oak Tree
Oak Resin is a Tree sap made from the Tapper when it is placed on an Oak Tree, taking 7 days, or 3 days with a Heavy Tapper.
Oak Resin can be obtained by tapping Oak Trees grown by the player or growing naturally in Stardew Valley (e.g., in Cindersap Forest). It is also a rare drop from Haunted Skulls, and can rarely be obtained after processing Hardwood in a Wood Chipper.
Although Oak Resin is labeled "Artisan Good" in-game, it does not benefit from the Artisan Profession, but instead from the Tapper Profession (+25% value).
