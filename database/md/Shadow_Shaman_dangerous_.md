**Shadow Shamans (dangerous)** are an enemy found in the Mines after activating the Shrine of Challenge or during the Danger In The Deep quest. 150 void spirits (any type) need to be killed for the Monster Eradication Goal at the Adventurer's Guild.

## Behavior

Dangerous Shadow Shamans are users of magic and behave identically to their weaker counterpart, the Shadow Shaman. They have a healing spell that heals the shaman itself and all enemies in the immediate area for 250 health. They also throw a green fireball that gives the player the Jinxed debuff when hit (Jinxed debuff reduces the player's Defense by 8). A ring of leaves appears around the Shadow Shaman when it is about to cast a spell.

## Strategy

Kill them first in combat, to prevent them from healing others. If you are hit by a curse spell, it is advisable to retreat before fighting other enemies.
