Artifacts
This tab keeps track of the type and amount of Artifacts collected. Entries are added upon finding the artifact. The artifact does not need to be donated to the Museum or shipped via the shipping bin to count towards the collection.
Note that artifacts found by tilling soil in The Mines or found in Artifact Troves may not appear as found on the collections tab. Dragging the artifact outside the inventory window and allowing it to be taken back into inventory may correct this. Holding the artifact in inventory overnight may also correct this.
Artifacts and their descriptions will not appear on the collections tab until they are donated to the Museum.
