Secrets
If Raisins are placed in a Junimo Hut, then the Junimos have a 20% chance to double harvest crops.[1] This is hinted at in Secret Note #24 and Secret Note #26. One bag of Raisins is consumed by the Junimos every week (except in Winter), and a small sign is placed outside of the hut. Multiple bags can be stacked in the hut, and they will be consumed over time.
