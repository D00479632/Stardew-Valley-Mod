## TitleKey Extension

I've consulted with the server people about installing TitleKey, but there are 3 known problems listed on the extension page -- the first two relate to extensions this wiki doesn't have, so they're no problem, but the third ("it breaks search suggestions for pages that are not in the main namespace") seems like it would be a problem for the Modding namespace. "Modding" is a separate namespace on the English wiki, and the corresponding translated words for "Modding" are separate namespaces on other language wikis. So, I don't see how to get around that problem, unless and until we upgrade to MediaWiki 1.36+. If you have any solutions or other ideas, I'd be happy to discuss them with the server people!

## Stardew Valley - Maru’s loved gifts.

I’m just a bit confused as to why you recently changed the “Dwarf Gadget” as being one of Maru’s loved gifts when it isn’t one? It’s one of her disliked gifts. This is misleading. Ellissten (talk) 11:54, 13 April 2024 (UTC)

Oh my gosh I am so sorry, I completely got this wrong and realised I haven’t updated my game to the newest version. Apologies! Ellissten (talk) 12:01, 13 April 2024 (UTC)
