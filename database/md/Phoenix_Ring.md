The **Phoenix Ring** is a ring that can be found in Volcano Dungeon rare chests.

If the player's health reaches 0 while wearing this ring, instead of passing out, the player will revive with half of their max health. This can only occur once per day. The exact amount of health the player revives with is `Max Health * 0.5 + Number of Phoenix Rings equipped`.\[1]
