Rabbits who eat every day mature after 6 nights have passed. A mature and fed rabbit produces Wool every 4 days, which sells for data-sort-value="340"&gt;340g. They will drop it on their own so they do not need to be sheared.

Wool can be placed in a Loom to produce Cloth, which sells for data-sort-value="470"&gt;470g.
