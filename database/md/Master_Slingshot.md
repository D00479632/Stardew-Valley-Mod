The **Master Slingshot** is a slingshot weapon that can be obtained from the chest on floor 70 of The Mines. After that, it can be purchased at the Adventurer's Guild for data-sort-value="1000"&gt;1,000g. Despite its description, many items other than Stone can be used as ammunition with the Master Slingshot.

Unlike most weapons, using a Master Slingshot on a villager will decrease friendship with them by 30 points. Using a master slingshot on the cat or dog will produce a "hate" dialogue bubble, but will not decrease friendship.

## Ammunition

To equip a slingshot with ammunition, select the ammunition, then Right-Click on the slingshot.

The type of ammunition used determines the damage dealt, according to the following formulas:

**Slingshot:**

`Damage = AmmoMultiplier + random number between [-(AmmoMultiplier / 2), AmmoMultiplier + 1]`

**Master Slingshot:**

`Damage = 2 * (AmmoMultiplier + random number between [-(AmmoMultiplier / 2), AmmoMultiplier + 1])`

With the worst ammo (*i.e.,* Fruits, Vegetables, or Eggs), a Slingshot can deal 1-3 and a Master Slingshot can deal 2-6 damage. With the best ammo, Iridium Ore and a Slingshot can deal 25-101 damage while a Master Slingshot can deal 50-202 damage.
