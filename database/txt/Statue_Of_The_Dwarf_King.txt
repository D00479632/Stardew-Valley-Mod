Powers
Every day, the Statue will offer two of its five available powers, listed below, for the player to choose from. The player can only choose one. All powers last for the duration of the in-game day.
Although the options the player can choose from are random, they are pre-determined at the start of the day. Therefore there is no benefit to crafting multiple statues or restarting the day as the player will just receive the same options to choose from.

Greater chance to find geodes
When this power is active, geodes found inside and outside of the mines have a (multiplicative) 25% higher chance of spawning when a rock is broken, either by hand or with bombs.[2]
Greater chance to find coal
When this power is active rocks broken in the mines have a (multiplicative) 40% higher chance to drop coal, or 20% if the player has the Prospector profession.[3] Outside, rocks not in the quarry are 3% more likely to drop coal. Rocks anywhere outside have a 2.5% chance to drop an additional coal. This will be on top of the higher chance to find coal that the player could have from the Prospector profession.[4]
Greater chance to find ladders and shafts
When this power is active, ladders and shafts will have a (multiplicative) 25% higher chance of dropping from rocks in The Mines or Skull Cavern. They will also have a 22% chance of dropping from monsters in these locations, increased from the usual 15%.[5]
Bombs cannot damage you
When this power is active, the player is immune to all damage from Cherry Bombs, Bombs, Mega Bombs[6], and Explosive Ammo inside and outside of the mines. The player is also immune to explosive damage from Hot Heads in the Volcano Dungeon.
