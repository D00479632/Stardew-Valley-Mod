The **Strange Bun** is a cooked dish. It is prepared using either the kitchen inside an upgraded farmhouse or a Cookout Kit.

Strange Bun may randomly appear in Krobus' shop on Saturdays, in the Stardrop Saloon's rotating stock or the Garbage Can outside the Saloon, or at the Traveling Cart for data-sort-value="225"675–1,125g. It may also be dropped by a Shadow Brute (4% chance). One Strange Bun may be received from opening a Mystery Box. If Krobus is the player's roommate, he may gift a Strange Bun in the morning.

By offering a Strange Bun to the Dark Shrine of Night Terrors in the Witch's Hut, players can toggle monster spawning on or off on their farm.
