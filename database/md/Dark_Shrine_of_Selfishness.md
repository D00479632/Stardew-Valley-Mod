From Stardew Valley Wiki

The **Dark Shrine of Selfishness** is an altar found in the Witch's Hut. It can be accessed after completing the Goblin Problem quest. The player can offer a Prismatic Shard to turn their children into doves, which permanently removes them from the game.

## Secrets

After turning children into doves, two secret events may occur.

**While watching TV...**  On the Standard Farm: Watching TV on Fall 26 and choosing "???" will display an Ancient Doll on the TV screen, along with an eerie message:

“ “You've brought this upon yourself... now I'm free... Hee hee hee!”

After this message, an Ancient Doll will pop out of the TV. Thereafter, there will be a cursed Ancient Doll in front of the Dark Shrine of Selfishness, which will fly around and attack the player. When slain, this Ancient Doll will turn into a bird shadow and fly away. Exiting and re-entering the Witch's Hut will respawn the doll.

On the Four-Corners Farm: Players may catch an Ancient Doll while fishing.

Note: Killing this doll counts toward the Monster Eradication goal of killing 200 bats, and Clint's "Cave Patrol" Special Order of killing bats as an option.

**Telephone message**  If the player owns a Telephone, they may receive a mysterious telephone call

“ “You place the receiver to your ear, and are met with a roiling, abrasive static. But wait... beneath it all, you can make out something else... an otherworldly voice... 'Y-O-U H-A-V-E F-O-R-S-A-K-E-N U-S'”
