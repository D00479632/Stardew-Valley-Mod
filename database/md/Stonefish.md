The **Stonefish** is a fish that can be caught in The Mines on the 20th floor during all seasons. The only other fish that can be caught on the 20th floor of the mines is the Ghostfish.

The chances of hooking a Stonefish depends on fishing level and on the fishing zone of the spot fished, increasing by 5% if a Curiosity Lure is equipped and by 10% if Stonefish Bait is equipped. For example, at level 10 fishing and fishing zone of 5, the chances of hooking a Stonefish is 7.5%. This increases to 12.5% with a Curiosity Lure equipped, to 17.5% with Stonefish Bait equipped, and to 22.5% with both a Curiosity Lure and Stonefish Bait equipped.\[1]

The Stonefish and the Octopus are the only fish caught with a fishing rod that cannot be eaten unless used in a recipe.

## Tailoring

Stonefish can be used in the spool of the Sewing Machine to create the Fishing Hat. It can be used in dyeing, serving as an orange dye at the dye pots, located in Emily's and Haley's house, 2 Willow Lane.

## Fish Pond

Stonefish can be placed in a Fish Pond, where they will reproduce every 5 days. The initial pond capacity is 1 fish, but the capacity can be increased to 10 by completing four quests. The primary output is dark brown Stonefish Roe, but Copper Ore is possible starting at population 3 and several more valuable items are possible starting at population 9.
