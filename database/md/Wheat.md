**Wheat** is a vegetable crop that grows from Wheat Seeds after 4 days. Wheat is harvested using a Scythe or better. Wheat has a 40% chance to also drop hay when harvested with any Scythe.\[1]

In addition to Beer, players have the ability to craft Wheat Flour from Wheat by using a Mill. Once placed in the mill, one wheat will make one wheat flour. Wheat flour will appear in the box on the right side of the mill the following morning.

## Multi-Seasonal Crop

Wheat may be planted in both Summer and Fall. There is no difference in its behavior in either season.

If a Wheat plant (of any growth stage) is in the ground on the 28th of Summer, it will continue growing on the 1st of Fall as though nothing had changed. Fertilizer in the ground underneath a Wheat plant on Summer 28 will not disappear on Fall 1. Fully-grown wheat plants may be left unharvested until the 1st of Fall to prevent fertilizer and tilled soil from disappearing.
