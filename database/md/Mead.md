**Mead** is an Artisan Good made from placing Honey inside a Keg, taking 10 hours. It is also available at the Ginger Island Resort for data-sort-value="800"&gt;800g. Pam sells Mead in her shop at the Desert Festival for data-sort-value="20"&gt; 20 Calico Eggs. Unlike Wine and Juice however, the value of the Mead is **not** affected by the type of honey used. The sell price of Mead is data-sort-value="300"&gt;300g, and only aging or the Artisan Profession can increase it. Several types of Flower Honey sell for more than Mead, so the player can actually lose gold by making Mead.

Mead can also be obtained for free from the bar in the Pirate Cove by speaking with the bartender while wearing the Pirate Hat, Deluxe Pirate Hat, Eye Patch, or Parrot Egg trinket. This can only be done once per night.

When consumed, Mead causes a Tipsy buff that decreases Speed by 1.

## Aged Values

Mead can be placed inside a Cask to age from normal quality to silver, gold, and eventually iridium quality. Iridium quality doubles the base sell price of Mead.

Normal, silver, and gold quality Mead can be prematurely removed from a cask at any time by striking the cask with an Axe, Hoe, or Pickaxe.
