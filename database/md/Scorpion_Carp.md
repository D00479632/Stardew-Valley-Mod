The **Scorpion Carp** is a fish that can be caught in the pond at The Desert during all seasons. It can also randomly be found in Garbage Cans after unlocking The Desert, or at the Traveling Cart for data-sort-value="150"450–1,000g. The only other fish that can be caught in the Desert is the Sandfish.

Since it is more valuable than the Sandfish, it is more difficult to catch and also has a lower bite rate. Catching the Scorpion Carp requires Fishing level 4, either naturally or by using fishing Buffs.

Scorpion Carp can be caught regardless of time of day using Magic Bait.
