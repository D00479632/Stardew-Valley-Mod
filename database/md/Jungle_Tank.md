## Animations

Most of the swimming creatures either move around without animating (*e.g.,* Pufferfish, Octopus) or move their tails / rear parts of their bodies at various speeds while swimming. However, some of the swimming creatures have unique animations:

- Eels and Lava Eels undulate up and down like a dolphin or whale (rather than side to side like an eel or other fish).
- Squids and Midnight Squids push with their tentacles much like the Blue Squid found in the mines with the Shrine of Challenge active.
- Stingrays flip their fins up and down as well as moving their tails.

For the bottom creatures, Frogs have unique animations for hopping around and inflating their vocal sacs.
