## New Editing

Thanks for coming to my TED talk. I'm Spider, not necessarily new to Stardew, but very interested in code. After tearing apart some of the Game Code and Data\\(files), I've found some inconsistencies in the wiki that I'm hoping to fix while working on my own interactive guide. I'll update my ongoing projects below.

### Bundles

Cleaning up incorrect information in Bundles and/or offering small bits to make it easier to read. For example, including the Farm Map locations for the River Fish which can be found in Riverlands, Forest (River, not Pond), Hill-Top, and Four Corners Farms as a header rather than separately only for Catfish(?). Including some more nuanced bits for more unique situations like Catfish being available in all seasons in the Secret Woods (raining), Witch's Hut (regardless of weather(?)), and is actually a Spring, Fall, and Winter fish, but is only available in Winter with a Rain Totem.
