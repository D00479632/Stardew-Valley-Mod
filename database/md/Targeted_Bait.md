Targeted Bait Increases your chance to catch \[fish name]. Information Source Bait Maker • Fish Shop Energy *Inedible* Sell Price 0.1 × Fish Price Crafting Equipment Bait Maker Processing Time ≤10m Ingredients Any fish (1) Produces 5-10 Targeted Bait

**Targeted Bait** is a specialized type of bait which increases the chance of hooking a specific fish in a given area *provided the fish can be caught in that area at that time, weather, and season.* The bite rate for any targeted bait is the same as for standard bait (reduces the delay before a nibble by 50%).\[1]

It can be obtained from a Bait Maker after putting in any fish, which will result in 5-10 "\[Fish Name] Bait." It will be finished crafting when the clock ticks over to the next 10-minute interval. The player can also purchase 8-12 targeted bait of a specific fish per day from the Fish Shop for double the sell price (0.2 x Fish price).

Using targeted bait made from a Legendary Fish the player has already caught does not allow them to catch another one.

Targeted Bait cannot be used with the Training Rod or the Bamboo Pole. Only the Fiberglass Rod, the Iridium Rod, and the Advanced Iridium Rod can use bait.

## Effects

When using targeted bait, the Locational Chance\[2] and Spawn Rate for the targeted fish are both multiplied by 1.66, after applying any relevant modifiers.\[3] These chances are capped at 1, so in most cases the Locational Chance adjustment will have no effect as most fish have a Locational Chance of 1. However, the Spawn Rate normally has a cap of 0.9, so this adjustment can guarantee a fish passing that check, assuming that a different item is not hooked first. In addition, when choosing from the list of possible catches for the area, the game will look at the first three items to pass both the Spawn Rate and Location-based checks. If the targeted fish is among them, the player will hook the targeted fish. Otherwise, the player will hook the third item, whatever it may be. If the game reaches the end of the list of possible catches before three items have passed both checks, it will loop back to the beginning of the list and check each item a second time.\[4] If it reaches the end of the list a second time, the player will hook trash.\[5]
