**Summer** is the second season new players play through. It is followed by Fall and preceded by Spring.

In Summer, the grass remains green, although noticeably yellower than the spring grass was. Butterflies can be seen flying across the screen. Any Spring-only crops wilt and die on the 1st of Summer. New crops, fish, and forageable items are available.

The Ice Cream Stand opens in summer.
