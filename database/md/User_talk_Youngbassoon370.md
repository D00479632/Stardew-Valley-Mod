## The wiki

Any editors out there, if ya need any info of anything like typos, ask me! Youngbassoon370 (talk) 16:06, 30 June 2021 (UTC)

## False information

Please remove my name from your user page, as the sentence with my name in it is false, as i have no recollection of you helping me in particular in any incedent. Fnaticlyric560 (talk) 16:08, 30 June 2021 (UTC)

Please don't make me have to do it, or have to get an admin like Margotbean to do it for me. Fnaticlyric560 (talk) 16:09, 30 June 2021 (UTC)

Thank you. Fnaticlyric560 (talk) 16:15, 30 June 2021 (UTC)

Don't you remember the "Horizonbot incedent"? I've been working, trying to fix all the deletions that occurred. Youngbassoon370 (talk) 16:20, 30 June 2021 (UTC)

Thank you for reminding me. In fact, there is something i would like help with, if you have time... Fnaticlyric560 (talk) 16:22, 30 June 2021 (UTC)

Done! Youngbassoon370 (talk) 16:24, 30 June 2021 (UTC)

## Pots lost

So I was playing on PlayStation 4 and found a big bug where i finished the pantry bundle, but I've waited a week to have Mrs. Mullner come to give me the recipe for the Garden Pot, but it never happened. If anyone has any info how to fix this bug, plz help me Youngbassoon370 (talk) 17:27, 25 September 2021 (UTC)

I even checked the parameters (6:00 to 11:30) but it still didn't work. Youngbassoon370 (talk) 17:30, 25 September 2021 (UTC)

I do not know anything about that, but you could ask User:margotbean on their talk page, because so many people see it. Fnaticlyric560 (talk) 17:46, 25 September 2021 (UTC)

You could also try to post about it on the stardew valley forums. Fnaticlyric560 (talk) 17:46, 25 September 2021 (UTC)

Thx!
