**Wine** is an Artisan Good made from the Keg, taking 7 days. It can also be received as a gift at the Feast of the Winter Star.

The sell price of Wine depends on the fruit used (3 × Base Fruit Value). When consumed, wine causes a Tipsy buff that decreases Speed by 1. The energy and health restored by Wine is equal to 1.75 × Base Fruit Value for edible fruit. For inedible fruit, Wine will restore energy equal to 25% Base Fruit Value and health equal to 11.25% Base Fruit Value.\[1] The color of the Wine also depends on the fruit used.

**Note:** It is possible to acquire Wine that has no base fruit (from the Traveling Cart or a Statue Of Endless Fortune, as a gift at the Feast of the Winter Star, or a New Year's Eve gift from Leah or Elliott). This item is simply titled "Wine", has a selling price of data-sort-value="400"&gt;400g (or data-sort-value="560"&gt;560g with the Artisan Profession), and restores 50 energy and 22 health.

## Aged Values

Wine can be placed inside a Cask to age from normal quality to silver, gold, and eventually iridium quality. Iridium quality doubles the base sell price of Wine.

Wine takes the longest to age of any item in Casks. It takes 2 seasons of aging to go from basic wine to iridium quality wine.

Normal, silver, and gold quality Wine can be prematurely removed from a cask at any time by striking the cask with an Axe, Hoe, or Pickaxe.
