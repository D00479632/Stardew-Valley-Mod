### Bug fixes

*All done!*

### Small changes

*All done!*

### Medium changes

- ☐ Add map property for default warp location (e.g. `Utility.getDefaultWarpLocation`).

### Refactoring

- ☐ Change all `const` fields to `static readonly`. They're accessed the same way and the performance difference is negligible, but that'll make the decompiled code much easier to understand, and avoid issues where const values get 'baked in' to mod assemblies.
