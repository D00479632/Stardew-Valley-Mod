I was looking at this and noticed that it doesn't fail gracefully when it's narrow. The current MainMenu is much more mobile-friendly that way. Zendowolf (talk) 08:26, 1 March 2021 (UTC)

Yep, I would have to adjust the stylesheet to accommodate a 3-column "Valley" layout. I'm not sure what other items that would affect, however. I have to experiment a bit, when I have time! margotbean (talk) 18:15, 1 March 2021 (UTC)
