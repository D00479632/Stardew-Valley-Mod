*For a detailed analysis of profit using the Preserves Jar, see Preserves Jar Productivity.*

**Jellies** and **Pickles** can be produced by inserting either a fruit or a vegetable / foraged item in a preserves jar, respectively. The value of a single jar of jelly or pickles is equal to (2 * Base Crop Value + 50). Jelly and pickles are unaffected by the quality of the fruit or vegetable used.

A preserves jar requires 4000 minutes, or 2-3 days, to produce jelly or pickles.\[1]

## Products

Quality of ingredients makes no difference to the finished product. The value of the finished product is determined using the base value (*i.e.,* with no silver or gold star) of the fruit/vegetable. However, the preserved version is always at least as profitable as even gold star produce, although the profit margin is lower compared to normal produce.
