- Foraging in the Ginger Island jungle in all seasons.

The Fiddlehead Fern is the only foraged item categorized as a vegetable. Being a vegetable, its sell price benefits from the Tiller 10% bonus and it can be turned into Pickles or Juice using a Preserves Jar or Keg. But it also receives several Foraging-related benefits, because it is obtained by foraging. Specifically, 7 Foraging XP is granted per fern and it benefits from the Gatherer double-harvest bonus and Botanist iridium-quality bonus.
