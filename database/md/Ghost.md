## Behavior

Ghosts will immediately hover towards the player upon entering the level. They will ignore physical obstacles, such as rocks, and can fly over the black space in the mines which the player cannot access. After hitting the player, Ghosts will teleport to a random location, firing back from the target. Ghosts move at a slower pace than bats do.

## Strategy

Stand still and swing at it with a club or a sword right before it hits you. High-damage but slow weapons are more efficient than quick, low-damage weapons such as daggers. Ghosts are knocked back several tiles after being hit, so walking towards them may speed up the process of killing them. Low weight weapons like daggers reduce this knockback, and the dagger special ability locks any affected enemy in place while in effect, dealing multiple hits without needing to chase it down or wait for it. Otherwise, wait until they slowly float back towards you for another strike.
