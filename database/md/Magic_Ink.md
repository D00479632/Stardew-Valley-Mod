Magic Ink Information Source Witch's Hut Sell Price *Cannot be sold*

**Magic Ink** can be found on a table in the Witch's Hut after completing the quest Goblin Problem. It can be returned to the Wizard in exchange for his gratitude. Returning the Ink also unlocks several new Farm Buildings that can be purchased from a book on a stand in the Wizard's Tower.

Once obtained, it can be found in the Special Items &amp; Powers tab in the Player's Menu. Oddly enough, it remains there after returning it to the Wizard.
