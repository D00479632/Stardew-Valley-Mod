Furniture can be purchased from Robin at the Carpenter's Shop or from the Traveling Cart merchant. Both shops offer a random selection of furniture each day they are open. The cost of furniture at the Traveling Cart is random, but is always between 250–2,500g. Prices at the Carpenter's Shop do not vary.
Some furniture can be obtained only by donating items to the Museum, purchased at Festivals, the Casino, JojaMart, or other unique sources. These exceptions are listed in the tables below.
After the first Farmhouse upgrade, Robin also offers the Furniture Catalogue for sale at the Carpenter's Shop. Once placed, "using" the furniture catalogue allows you to purchase furniture items for 0g in unlimited quantity.
There is a small chance of finding random furniture items when engaging in various tasks, such as slaying monsters, breaking open crates, shaking or chopping trees, tilling Artifact Spots, or panning.
Most furniture can be placed outside.[1] However, some items cannot be placed anywhere other than inside the Farmhouse or a Shed. Furniture will display a green square on tiles where it can be placed. The tile will turn red if the furniture cannot be placed.
Players can sit in chairs, benches, couches, and armchairs.
Furniture cannot be sold through the Shipping Bin or to any merchant/shop, and cannot be gifted to villagers.
Controls
Computer: Right-click on furniture while selected to rotate or place it, depending on the item. Some furniture can be easily picked up and moved by left-clicking.
Nintendo Switch: Use the Y button to pick up and place furniture, the A button to rotate furniture, and the R Stick to choose where to place furniture.
Xbox: Press X or A to quick-place without placement guide and X to remove - it will not place if there’s not enough space. To remove an item, stand in front of it and click X. For more control, use the right toggle to move the item around the room and press X to place/remove - this displays a faded image of the item and the placement guide to show where it can or cannot be placed. Some items can be rotated using A before placing.
On all systems, some furniture can only be picked up by using a tool, or by holding the 'use tool' button (left-click on computer) to remove it once it is placed.
Chairs
Chairs can be placed outside.
All chairs available in the Furniture Catalogue can also be purchased from the Traveling Cart for 250–2,500g.

Exploits
Chairs (and other furniture that the player can sit on) can be used to bypass normal barriers in gameplay. By placing the chair, sitting on it, and then exiting the chair on the other side, the player can access areas that are normally unreachable.
If an item is placed on a table in multiplayer and more than one player picks it up at the exact same time, the item will be duplicated, with each player receiving a copy of the item.

History
1.0: Introduced.
1.1: Made most furniture available for sale from the Furniture Catalogue. Added several new items.
1.3.27: Fireplaces are now moveable. Added several new items.
1.4: Dressers can now be used to store clothing, hats, shoes, and rings.
1.5: Most furniture can now be placed outside. Beds are now moveable. Players can now sit in chairs. Added new items (including Fish Tanks category), new sources, and a new farm type, the Beach farm.
1.6: Added 280 new pieces of furniture. Five new themed item catalogues: Joja Furniture Catalogue, Wizard Catalogue, Junimo Catalogue, Retro Catalogue, and Trash Catalogue. Decorative lanterns now emit light. Starry Double Bed, Strawberry Double Bed, and Pirate Double Bed are no longer obtainable from the Furniture Catalogue. There's now a small chance to find furniture items while doing random tasks. Several existing furniture items' description changed from "Can be placed inside your house." to "Can be placed as decoration." Furniture can no longer be placed on top of crops.
1.6.9: Beds can now be placed in any constructed buildings that allow furniture.
