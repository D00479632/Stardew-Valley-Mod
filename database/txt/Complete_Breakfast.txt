Complete Breakfast is a cooked dish. It is prepared using either the kitchen inside an upgraded farmhouse or a Cookout Kit.
Complete Breakfast may randomly appear in Krobus' shop on Saturdays, in the Garbage Can outside the saloon, or in the Stardrop Saloon's rotating stock. The Statue Of Endless Fortune produces one Complete Breakfast per year on Alex's birthday, Summer 13. Five Complete Breakfasts are the reward for completing the Home Cook's Bundle on the Bulletin Board (Remixed). One Complete Breakfast may be received from opening a Mystery Box.
In total ingredients, cooking a Complete Breakfast from scratch requires 2 Eggs, 1 Oil, 1 Wheat Flour, 1 Potato, and 1 Milk.
