**Jewels Of The Sea** is a power book that can be obtained from Fishing Treasure Chests after reaching Fishing level 5. The chance for a treasure chest to contain the book starts at 2% and increases by 0.1% for each treasure chest opened until it is obtained. Then the chance stays at 2.1% permanently. It cannot appear until the player has opened at least 3 fishing treasure chests.\[1]

It can also be purchased from the Bookseller for data-sort-value="20000"&gt;20,000g starting in Year 3 (≈9% chance to appear).\[2]

The first reading grants the player a power that makes all fishing treasure chests have a 25% chance to yield 1-6 Roe.\[1] The type of roe obtained is the same as the fish that was caught. Once read, it can be found in the Player's menu on the Special Items &amp; Powers tab. Each subsequent reading gives the player 100 Fishing XP.
