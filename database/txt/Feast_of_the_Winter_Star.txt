The Feast of the Winter Star is a festival that takes place on the 25th of every Winter. The player attends the festival by entering Pelican Town between 9am and 2pm. When the player leaves the festival, they will be returned to The Farm at 10pm.
The main event of the Feast of the Winter Star is secret gift-giving. A random villager will be selected to give the player a gift, and the player is assigned a random villager to give a gift to. A week beforehand, on the 18th, Mayor Lewis will send a letter telling the player who their gift recipient is. The player finds out who is giving them a gift at the festival.
The festival ends when the player leaves Pelican Town.

“ “Dear [Player],
I would like to give you some information about an upcoming event: the Feast of the Winter Star. It's a time for the community to come together and think back on all the good fortune we've had this year.
A favorite tradition is the "secret gift exchange", where everyone in town is randomly assigned to someone else. On the day of the festival, everyone brings a gift for their secret friend and surprises them with something special!

This year, your secret friend is:
[Villager]
Don't tell anyone! The feast will take place on the 25th from 9AM to 2PM at the town square. See you then!
-Mayor Lewis”
Trivia
Speaking to Willy gives the player the option to hear the story of the Winter Star:
"In the night sky of winter, there is a bright star only visible from this valley. No one knows why this is... but in times of old people would come from far and wide to see it. They believed that anyone who laid eyes on the Winter Star would be blessed with good fortune. Some even claim that the mysterious fruit known as Stardrop is connected to the Winter Star in some way."
On the shipping summary screen at end of the 24th day of Winter, Santa Claus will ride across the sky with a few reindeer in his sleigh.
If the player talks to George, he will deprecate the feast and shout "Humbug!", a reference to Ebenezer Scrooge, the elderly protagonist of Charles Dickens' novel A Christmas Carol.
It is possible to have your secret friend be Lewis. If that happens, Lewis will still send you a letter telling you so, and will still act surprised when you give him his gift.
Bugs
It's possible for Leo to be the secret friend after the player meets him but before he moves from Ginger Island to the mainland. In this case, Leo does not attend the festival, so the player cannot give him a gift (and then cannot receive a gift).
