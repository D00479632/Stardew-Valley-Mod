From Stardew Valley Wiki

**Flowers** are a category that includes several crops grown on the farm. In addition, two foraged plants, Crocus and Sweet Peas, are considered to be flowers. Other foraged items that are real-life flowers (*e.g.,* Dandelions and Daffodils) are categorized as Forage instead of Flower and therefore are not included here.

All flowers share several in-game characteristics:

- Their sell prices are increased by 10% if the player has the Tiller profession (even foraged Crocus and Sweet Pea).
- Flowers grown as crops (*i.e.,* other than Crocus and Sweet Pea) will affect the type of Honey produced by nearby Bee Houses.
- Flowers (other than Poppy) are a universally liked gift; all villagers other than Clint, George, and Sebastian like them. Gifting foraged flowers can be an inexpensive way to level up friendship.
- Flowers (combined with Forage and Tree Sap) are one category used when scoring items in the Grange Display at the Stardew Valley Fair.
- They can be sold at the General Store (as well as in the Shipping Bin).
- All shipped flowers are added to the Items Shipped page of the Collections tab.

The following tables lists all flowers, where to obtain them, how much they sell for, and the prices of the Honey produced by nearby Bee Houses.
