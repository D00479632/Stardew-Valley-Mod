## Seeds per Crop

The Seed Maker can produce 1-3 seeds of the same variety as the input crop (97.51% chance, average of 2 seeds), 1-4 Mixed Seeds (1.99% chance), or 1 packet of Ancient Seeds (0.5% chance).

To avoid buying new seeds, an average of 51% of harvests would need to be sacrificed (= 1 / (0.9751 * 2)) to obtain new seeds for the next growing cycle.

The type and number of seeds produced is determined by the time of day and location of the Seed Maker.\[1]
