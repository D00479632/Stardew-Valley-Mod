From Stardew Valley Wiki

*For information about how the game saves progress on mobile devices, see Mobile Saves.*

The game **saves** progress when the in-game day ends, *i.e.,* when the farmer goes to bed, collapses from exhaustion, or collapses at 2am. All progress during a day is lost if the player quits the game without ending the day. In multiplayer, the game saves after all players click through the prompts at end of day and wake up in the morning.

Save files are tagged with the version of the game that last saved the file (*e.g.,* `<gameVersion>1.6.15</gameVersion>`). An older version of the game is not able to load a newer save file, but a *newer* version can load an older save. Once a newer version saves over an older save file (*e.g.,* when you save for the first time after the game itself was updated to a new version), the save file will be tagged with the newer version number.

A save file may be transferred to a different device family (*e.g.,* from mobile to PC) as long as the game version on the receiving device is not older than the save file's version tag. For example, a save file from a mobile device running version 1.5 can be transferred to and used on a PC running 1.6.15, but a 1.6.15 PC save file will not run on a mobile device with version 1.5.

## Save format

The saves are stored as XML files on your computer or mobile device. They're stored separately from your game, so you can safely reinstall or update the game without losing them. On PC, they're shared between different copies of the game (*e.g.,* if you buy it from both GOG and Steam).

Each save has a folder like `JonSnow_123456789`, with two main files inside it: `JonSnow_123456789` and `SaveGameInfo`. Both files are needed to load the save.

## Find your save files

Note: in multiplayer, the save is only on the main player's computer.

### Windows

1. Press Windows + R to show a 'run' dialogue box.
2. Paste this exact text:
   
   ```
   %appdata%\StardewValley\Saves
   ```
3. Click 'OK' to open the folder.

### Linux

The root directory for save files is specified by the XDG\_CONFIG\_HOME environment variable, which defaults to `~/.config/`

1. From *Files*, click *Go » Enter Location*.
2. Enter this exact text:
   
   ```
   ~/.config/StardewValley/Saves
   ```
3. Submit to open the folder.  
   If you're using flatpak, it might be at

## Troubleshooting

### Save disappeared or doesn't load

Here's how to recover your save in most cases. (Note that save issues are almost always caused by the game itself, not mods.)

1. Find your save files.
2. Recover the files:
   
   - If the files are still there, here are some common fixes (try one at a time):
     
     1. If some of the files have `_STARDEWVALLEYSAVETMP` in the name, remove that from their name and reload the game. You may need to first disable Steam cloud saves for SDV, as it can keep automatically renaming them every time you reload. To do that, go to Stardew Valley in your Steam library, click the gear icon and go to Properties, and uncheck the option to sync cloud saves.
     2. If you recently renamed or created the folder (*e.g.,* to restore a backup), make sure the folder name **exactly** matches the file that looks like `FarmName_0123456789`.
     3. Try undoing the last save.
     4. If you are on PC, ensure that the game files do not have an extension like `.bin`. If you are on Android, you may need to add the file extension `.bin`.
     5. Modded saves may not be able to load in the vanilla game, depending on the mods that were used. If you previously played with mods but are trying to launch the game in vanilla, try reinstalling SMAPI and playing a day. SMAPI will automatically clean up any custom content from your save. Note that if you still have custom items in your inventory, they will turn into blank error items and may cause issues.
   - If the files are missing but you have SMAPI installed, see restore a backup by SMAPI.
   - If the files are there but newer game progress is missing, it's possible Steam Cloud Sync / GOG Galaxy / mobile equivalent automatically replaced your save with the version it had stored. To solve:
     
     1. Launch the game. (Don't load a save yet.)
     2. While the game is still running, delete your save folder and put your backup back in.
     3. Load the save.
     4. The cloud backup service will detect that the save changed while the game was running, so it'll treat that as the new version to save.
3. If the above fixes didn't help, see this guide or ask for help; we might be able to recover the save for you.

Note: don't keep backup folders in the saves folder, since the game will try to load them. Either move those into a different folder, or delete them.

### Undo the last save

If something went wrong, you can undo the last save.

For a save from Linux/Mac/Windows/Android:

1. Find your save files.  
   You should see two files with an `_old` suffix in the name; if not, ask for help instead!
2. Back up your save folder just in case.
3. Delete `SaveGameInfo` and the file that looks like `FarmName_123456789`.
4. Remove the `_old` suffix from `SaveGameInfo_old` and the file that looks like `FarmName_123456789_old`.

For a save from iOS:

1. Find your save files.  
   You should see a file with an `_SVBAK` suffix in the name; if not, ask for help instead!
2. Back up your save folder just in case.
3. Delete the files that look like `YourName_123456789` and `YourName_123456789_SVEMERG`.
4. Remove the `_SVBAK` suffix from the file that looks like `YourName_123456789_SVBAK`.

### Restore a backup by SMAPI

If you use the SMAPI modding API, the bundled `SaveBackup` mod keeps up to 10 daily backups of your saves. Even if the original save was completely deleted or corrupted, you can probably recover it from SMAPI's backup.

To restore a save backup:

1. Find your game folder.
2. Open the `save-backups` subfolder.
3. Unzip (or 'extract') the latest backup which has your save.
4. Copy the save folder back into your Saves folder.

## Advanced

### Edit a save

A save file open in Sublime Text with formatted XML.

You can edit your save to fix some common issues or change your choices. **This can permanently break your save if you make a mistake; don't forget to create a backup first.** You should also avoid automatic save editor tools, since they often break the save.

1. Install Sublime Text for Linux, Mac, or Windows. (If you already have another text editor which supports XML formatting, feel free to use that instead.)
2. Install the Package Control extension for Sublime Text.
3. Use the Package Control extension to install the *Indent XML* and *XPath* plugins (see how to add plugins).
4. Make a backup of your save file just in case something goes wrong.
5. Open your save file (the file that looks like `Name_0123456789`) in Sublime Text.
6. Click Selection &gt; Format &gt; Indent XML.
7. Make any changes you want and save. (See the sections below, this guide for changing the host of a co-op save, and this guide for other changes.)

**Tips:**

- Click an element, and press `CTRL` + `SHIFT` + `[` to collapse the whole section which contains it. This is useful when you want to ignore a large field. For example, given this text in the save file:
  
  ```
  <ArrayOfInt>
      <int>1981</int>
      <int>0</int>
      <int>0</int>
      <int>0</int>
      <int>0</int>
      <int>0</int>
  </ArrayOfInt>
  ```
  
  Click on one of the `<int>` fields and press those keys, and it will collapse into this:
  
  ```
  <ArrayOfInt> […]
  </ArrayOfInt>
  ```
- Click any element, and look in the status bar to see the path to where you are in the save format (like `/SaveGame/player/friendships/item[32]`).

### Duplicate a save

You can duplicate a save for testing purposes, or to explore different options without starting over.

1. Find your save files.
2. Create the new save folder:
   
   1. Duplicate the target save folder.
   2. Rename the new folder:
      
      - change the name so you can recognize it in-game;
      - change the number at the end to any number that's not used by another save.
   3. Open the new folder for the next steps.
3. Prepare the new files:
   
   1. Delete (or apply the following steps to, if you want the backup as well) any file whose name ends with `_old` or `.back.*`.
   2. Rename the file that looks like `Name_0123456789` to match your new folder name.
4. Edit the save metadata:
   
   1. Open the `SaveGameInfo` file in a text editor like Notepad.
   2. Look for `<name>` on the first line. Your farmer's name should be right after that. Change it to your new name.
   3. Search for the 2nd mention of your name (ctrl+f to 'find') and change it to your new name.
5. Edit the save file:
   
   1. Open the file that looks like `Name_0123456789` in a text editor like Notepad.
   2. Look for `<name>` on the first line. Your farmer's name should be right after that. Change it to your new name.
   3. Search for the 2nd mention of your name (ctrl+f to 'find') and change it to your new name.
   4. Search for the old save ID (`<uniqueIDForThisGame>`, the number from the old filename). Change it to your new number.

That's it! Launch the game and check the load menu; you'll see both saves now.

### Change farm type

If you use SMAPI (mods):

You can change farm type by loading your save in-game, then entering `set_farm_type FARM_ID_HERE` in the SMAPI console window. (You can enter `set_farm_type list` to see a list of farm type IDs.)

That will change the farm map, but everything placed on the farm will stay where it is. You may have things in an invalid position, like trees in a lake. You can either install Noclip Mode to reach things that are out of bounds, or run one of these console commands:

command effect `world_clear farm debris` remove stones, branches, weeds, and dead crops. `world_clear farm trees` remove non-fruit trees. `world_clear farm fruit-trees` remove fruit trees. `world_clear farm grass` remove tall grass. `world_clear farm everything` remove *everything*, including placed objects.

If you play without mods:

You can change farm type by editing your save file:

1. Open your save file for editing.
2. Search for `<whichFarm>`. The number after that open tag is the farm type.
3. Change the number to the one you want:
   
   Code Farm Type 0 Standard Farm 1 Riverland Farm 2 Forest Farm 3 Hilltop Farm 4 Wilderness Farm 5 Four Corners Farm 6 Beach Farm 7 Meadowlands Farm

That will change the farm map, but everything placed on the farm will stay where it is. You may have things in an invalid position, like trees in a lake. You can take note of what's out of bounds, then switch back to the old farm type and move them.

### Remove an NPC

You can remove an NPC from your save file (*e.g.,* to fix an NPC permanently stuck in an invalid place). If it still exists in the game data, the NPC will respawn when you reload the save file. This should be a last resort, and usually isn't needed when using SMAPI since it'll remove invalid NPCs automatically.

1. Open your save file for editing. Make sure you format the file for readability per those instructions.
2. Remove the NPC:
   
   1. Search for the NPC's default name between 'name' tags (*e.g.,* to remove Penny: `<name>Penny</name>`).
   2. Remove the entire 'NPC' section containing the line you found, starting from the previous `<NPC>` line up to and including the next `</NPC>` line.
3. *(optional)* Remove the NPC friendship data:
   
   1. Search for the NPC's default name between 'string' tags (*e.g.,* to remove Penny: `<string>Penny</string>`).
   2. Remove the entire 'item' section containing the line you found, starting from the previous `<item>` line up to the next `</item>` line.
