Willy

The **Fish Shop** is the home of Willy. It's located on the docks of the Beach south of Pelican Town. The shop can be entered beginning on Spring 2 Year 1. Although the door will unlock on Saturdays, the shop will be closed unless it is raining, with the exception of Winter 13, the second day of SquidFest.

Willy sells a variety of fishing-related supplies, including rods, bait, tackle, fish tanks, and crab pots. Some items, such as tackles, become available once the player reaches a specific fishing level. Those items can be purchased as soon as the appropriate skill level is achieved, without needing to wait until the next day. Other items, such as the Copper Pan and the Deluxe Fish Tank, require the player to complete specific tasks to become available.

He will not buy any other catchable items (Trash, Green Algae, Seaweed, White Algae, Cave Jelly, River Jelly, or Sea Jelly). He will also not buy Aged Roe, Caviar, or Smoked Fish.

## Player-Derived Stock

If the player chooses to sell items to Willy, there is a chance they will appear in the list of items for sale, especially if sold to Willy in large quantity. Any of these items will be available for purchase in limited quantities. Additional villager dialogues may appear indicating they've seen or purchased the items.

## Bobber Machine

Bobber Machine selection showing all 39 options

At the right of the Fish Shop is a Bobber Machine which allows players to choose different bobber styles. Along with selecting a specific bobber style, the player can also select a randomized option, which chooses a bobber for each cast at random from all of the unlocked options.

At the start of the game, only the default bobber style can be chosen. A new bobber style will unlock each time the player catches 2 new fish. Bobber styles are always unlocked in order. For example, the 10th bobber style will unlock after the player catches 18 different fish.

There are a total of 39 different bobber styles to unlock. To unlock all of the bobber styles, the player must catch a total of 76 different fish. There are a total of 77 different fish in the game (the 72 found in the Fish tab in the Collections menu and the 5 Legendary Fish II).

## Willy's Boat

Anytime after Summer 1 of Year 1, entering the Fish Shop (with or without Willy present) will trigger a "teaser" cutscene. In the cutscene, Willy chats with the player about their fishing progress, then mentions that business at the Fish Shop could be better. Willy says that he is working so hard, he has no time for his own projects. He says he has an "old friend" in the back who has seen better days. Willy then hints that if business picks up, he will show the player what he has in the back room.

Willy and Robin put the Ginger Island boat back into operation.

When the player completes the Community Center Bundles or views the Joja Warehouse completion cutscene, Willy will mail the player an invitation to come to the back room of his shop. Upon entering the back room, the player finds a dock with an old boat that needs repair. The boat can provide transportation to and from Ginger Island at a ticket price of data-sort-value="1000"&gt;1,000g, but Willy does not have the materials needed for repairs.

To repair the boat, the player must provide:

- Hardwood (200) for the hull
- Iridium Bar (5) for the anchor
- Battery Pack (5) for the ticket stand

Once the player makes all 3 boat repairs, the game generates an overnight cutscene in which Willy and Robin work to restore the boat. Note that this cutscene is delayed a day if another overnight cutscene is scheduled for the same night.

Starting the day after viewing the boat repair cutscene with Willy &amp; Robin, the player can buy a boat ticket in the back room. The Fish Shop door also unlocks at 8am instead of 9am. After getting the Key To The Town, the player can access the boat at any time in regular days. In both cases, Willy's own schedule does not change. He pilots the boat, but he becomes available automatically whenever the player purchases a ticket and doesn't need to be in the shop beforehand.

By fishing inside the boat room, there is a 20% chance to catch a Lifesaver.\[2]

## Trivia

- Interacting with the ladder at the back of the shop results in a message that suggests Willy lives upstairs.
- If the player attempts to enter the Fish Shop on Spring 1, Year 1, a note on the door says "Gone Fishing, be back tomorrow".
- After the shop is closed, Willy will return to the fish shop, usually at around 12:30am. Once he has returned to the shop, he will be at the counter. The player can still access his shop after this time when returning from Ginger Island or using the Key To The Town.
