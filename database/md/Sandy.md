## Relationships

Sandy allows Mr. Qi to operate his casino behind her shop. It's clear they're not close, but she accepts his money and "looks the other way" with whatever he's doing back there. She mentions that she's friends with Emily; during the first meeting with the player she mentions that Emily wrote to her about "the new farmer" in town. She also mentions that "my friend runs a shop in the desert", referring to the Desert Trader.

Hi! Welcome to 'Sandy's Oasis'! Hey, you look just like the new farmer that Emily wrote to me about! Then... the bus line to Stardew Valley is back in service! Oh, I'm so happy!”

**Regular**

*Saturday*

“ “Hi! Welcome to Sandy's Oasis, the number one destination in Calico Desert!

\*whisper* Did I sound professional? Make sure to check out our seasonal seed selection. You look really thirsty. Here, have a taste of this ice cold milk. \[gifts Player milk] Tasty, huh?”

**4+ Hearts**

*Thursday*

“ “Hey... I think I can trust you. You can keep a secret, right? \*whisper* That guy in the back... it's some kind of exclusive club. I've never been inside myself, but they pay me a generous monthly rent so I don't ask any questions. SOOOOoo! How's that Stardew Valley weather right now?”

*Friday*

“ “My name's not really Sandy, you know. It's just good for business. But everyone calls me Sandy anyway, so I've just gotten used to it.”

“ “Hi!~ Stay as long as you like. The air conditioning sure feels nice, doesn't it?”

*Wednesday*

“ “Hey, it's \[Player]! I'm glad to see you, kid. I was starting to think you'd never come back!

If I didn't have this shop to run I'd come back to the valley with you for a day or two... just you and me on the old farm. You'll just have to visit me more often so I don't get depressed.”
