Ingredients Any Fish (1)
Coal (1)
Smoked Fish is an Artisan Good made from the Fish Smoker using any fish and 1 coal, taking 50 minutes. It doubles the sell price of the fish while retaining quality, as well as multiplying the energy and health restoration by 1.5.
Smoked fish benefit from the Fisher and Angler professions, as well as the Artisan profession. Thus, if the player does not have the Artisan profession, the Smoked Fish will always sell for 2 times as much as the original fish. If the player has the Artisan profession, the Smoked Fish will always sell for 2.8 times as much as the original fish.
Because Smoked fish is an Artisan Good, it can be sold at Pierre's General Store but cannot be sold to Willy at the Fish Shop.
