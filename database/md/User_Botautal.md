From Stardew Valley Wiki

Botautal is an unkillable mob wich plays Stardew Valley. When playing the game, there's a 0% chance that it will fly past. There's also a 0% chance that The Player encounters Botautal when doing nothing. Always when the Player is AFK, Botautal comes and does nothing. He maybe talks to the AFK Player. When getting slain, Botautal will drop an Infinity Blade but no Glazed Yams. A person who doesn't exist says, he drops a lot of Triple Shot Espresso too.
