## Behavior

They will move suddenly as well as hover over rocks, and shoot fireballs at the player, which ricochet off walls.

## Strategy

Simply move in quickly and hit them. They have only 1 health, and can be defeated with a single hit from any weapon. A Slingshot can be used with any ammo to safely kill them from a distance. Their fireballs can also be hit and destroyed; however, fireballs will *not* be stopped by a sword's secondary attack.
