## Images

Hi, I just saw you upload the racer images for Desert Festival, I was wondering how did you get them? I've used StardewXnbHack but then the images are only 16x16 inside a larger file, yours are 48x48 px. Thanks! :) YuvixAdun (talk) 04:30, 5 April 2024 (UTC)

Hey! I have no idea if this is the most efficient way, but this is my process for getting sprites: (1) Use StardewXnbHack to unpack the Content folder. (2) Find relevant sprite sheets from LooseSprites, TileSheets, or a few other places. (3) Use https://ezgif.com/sprite-cutter to cut the sprite sheet, usually into 16x16 images. If it's a big sprite sheet, then I'll crop it smaller first. (4) Download each small sprite and upload them into https://lospec.com/pixel-art-scaler/, resizing them by 300% (so they become 48x48). I hope that was helpful! Bluestblur (talk) 04:36, 5 April 2024 (UTC)

Awesome, that's the answer I was looking for :) YuvixAdun (talk) 05:38, 5 April 2024 (UTC)

## Help

Hey I was wondering if you could please help me with the trash catalogue png. I myself don't unpack images from the game files. I just use a website that has the images, but the trash catalogue icon image on the website is no good either. I was wondering if there was any way you could upload a correctly sized png of the trash catalogue icon. Its messing up the graphs in furniture and giving me a hard time trying to correctly size them. Ps. I know for a fact that the image has to be at least 48px by 48px if that helps. Emily Romano (talk) 01:31, 17 April 2024 (UTC)

Hey! I'd be glad to help. I've noticed you've been hard at work with all the furniture changes, which is great! Give me one sec, and I should be able to upload a properly sized image. Bluestblur (talk) 01:34, 17 April 2024 (UTC)

Oh my gosh you're amazing, and thanks for the acknowledgement. I have been trying so hard lately because I want everyone to be able to see the new furniture options. That way they are able to start planning their houses if they want to. I myself am a mobile user, but I already got my 1.6 house all planned out. Emily Romano (talk) 01:37, 17 April 2024 (UTC)

Ps. Hey there again, sorry to bother you but I think the trash catalogue png needs to have the see through sides of it cut off, like the other catalogue pngs. This is the reason it is not formating correctly, when sized. Emily Romano (talk) 01:42, 17 April 2024 (UTC)

No worries, you're not bothering me! I did cut off the sides when cropping the image, and I have no idea why it looks so squished right now lol. I think it sometimes takes a bit before image changes actually appear on the wiki, so let's wait and see. If it doesn't work, then I can try again. Bluestblur (talk) 01:47, 17 April 2024 (UTC)

Hey there, I don't know if you wanna give that trash catalogue png another try, but it would be much appreciated. Thank you for all your help. Emily Romano (talk) 03:02, 17 April 2024 (UTC)

I just cropped it again, but it looks exactly the same as the first file I uploaded. Also, weirdly enough, clicking on the 'new' image thumbnail on the file page still takes me to the previous image, so perhaps my image hasn't been fully processed yet? Let's give it a little more time - hopefully it doesn't look weird by tomorrow. Sorry I couldn't be of more help, I know it looks really odd right now! Bluestblur (talk) 03:12, 17 April 2024 (UTC)

Thats ok, thanks for trying again though. Also thanks for uploading all the new sized images, I know it improves their quality. Emily Romano (talk) 03:14, 17 April 2024 (UTC)

Last thing, do you know how to update the sections at the bottom of the furniture page. The part that has the categories and all links to the items within them? I'd like to start working on that but I have no idea how to get the 1.6 furniture links to pop up. Emily Romano (talk) 03:21, 17 April 2024 (UTC)

Those big sections at the bottom of the page are called "navboxes", and you can find the specific furniture navbox here: Template:NavboxFurniture Bluestblur (talk) 03:27, 17 April 2024 (UTC)

Thanks, for letting me know. Emily Romano (talk) 03:35, 17 April 2024 (UTC)

No problem! Good luck with adding all the new furniture links to that navbox! Bluestblur (talk) 03:36, 17 April 2024 (UTC)

## Hi again, Help Requested

Hey there, hope you are doing good. I have finally got all the 1.6 furnture onto the English furniture page. Except 3 little pesky items: Decorative Walnut Ladder, Decorative Oak Ladder, and the Decorative Hatch. I haven't been able to upload the 3 items because I don't know what they are. Such as a decoration, a floor piece or something that hangs on the wall. I was wondering if the data you use might know? I would love to get these last little items up and linked. Emily Romano (talk) 00:11, 19 April 2024 (UTC)

Hey! The Decorative Walnut Ladder and Decorative Oak Ladder are considered "paintings" since they attach to the wall. I'd say they can go into the "Wall Hangings" category. The Decorative Hatch is considered "decor", so perhaps it could go with the "Small Decorations"? I hope that helps! I can also resize the two ladder images in a bit. Bluestblur (talk) 00:40, 19 April 2024 (UTC)

Thanks so much can finally check this off the list. I'll get right on it. Emily Romano (talk) 00:44, 19 April 2024 (UTC)

## Gifting

Thank you so much for updating *all* the gifting pages! Analyzing gift tastes was how I got started editing the wiki; I even created a program in C# that ran through all possible items and spit out each and every result! Although that has been obsolete since v1.4...

Anyway, I appreciate all the hard work you put into it! Including fixing up some gift tastes that got missed with v1.5. Thank you!! margotbean (talk) 06:59, 12 June 2024 (UTC)

## Translation into Arabic

Hello dear I am one of the Stardo Valley players and fans Unfortunately, there is no support for Arabic, neither on the game nor even on Wiki That's why I decided to translate wiki pages into Arabic My question is, is that possible? And if yes, how, please Monster korona (talk) 04:37, 7 July 2024 (UTC)

## Which one is correct?

Hey bro,thanks for ur hard working!I\`m from Chinese wiki.I need show you sth.

In the article"**hats table**":

Blue Cowboy Hat ~3.8% chance

Red Cowboy Hat ~3.8% chance

White Turban ~3.8% chance

Dark Cowboy Hat ~3.8% chance

And In the article"**Treasure Rooms" table**":

Blue Cowboy Hat ~1.8% chance

Red Cowboy Hat ~1.8% chance

White Turban ~3.6% chance

Dark Cowboy Hat ~3.6% chance

And **Separate pages** for each hat:

**Blue Cowboy Hat** ~1.92% chance

**Red Cowboy Hat** ~1.92% chance

**White Turban** ~3.85% chance

**Dark Cowboy Hat** ~3.85% chance

Yes,These chance all changed by you.That\`s why I\`m asking you.I need an accurate answer,so I can update Chinese wiki.Have a nice day!骑凤散人 (talk) 19:54, 12 August 2024 (UTC)

This is an excellent question! I'm afraid we may have lost Bluestblur...

I've removed the percentages from the Hats page, but the individual pages and the Skull Cavern page still need to be synched up. I'll put that on my "to do" list... margotbean (talk) 21:53, 14 August 2024 (UTC)

Ya,seems that it\`s the only way we can choose.Maybe he\`s busy in real life.骑凤散人 (talk) 22:35, 14 August 2024 (UTC)

I looked in the game code, and looked at the timestamps for the edits to the individual pages vs. the Skull Cavern page, and I think the Skull Cavern %s are the correct ones. margotbean (talk) 22:10, 15 August 2024 (UTC)

OK!I will do my work.骑凤散人 (talk) 02:17, 16 August 2024 (UTC)

Well,I will change %s after EN wiki.骑凤散人 (talk) 02:36, 16 August 2024 (UTC)

If you have the energy and the will to change the EN wiki, please do so! With my gratitude! margotbean (talk) 04:31, 16 August 2024 (UTC)

I know now!Sir Bluestblur is right.the Skull Cavern page says the following"All percent chances listed below are assuming that the player has claimed Farming Mastery (for the Golden Animal Cracker) and Combat Mastery (for the Trinkets). If either or both have not been claimed, then the chances for all other available items are slightly increased."

That means percent chances of individual pages are calculated according to the latter case.

So,no need change individual pages.I apologize.骑凤散人 (talk) 07:42, 16 August 2024 (UTC)
