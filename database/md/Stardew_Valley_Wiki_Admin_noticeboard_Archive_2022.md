## Transfer watchlist from old wiki

See User:Pathoschild/Transfer watchlist for instructions if you want to transfer your watchlist from the old wiki. —Pathoschild (talk) 20:46, 18 February 2021 (UTC)

## Some problems about Chinese wiki

After moving back the wiki to the old domain, there are some problems on Chinese wiki that I can't solve. So I post these problems here, hoping that any administrator can help me.

1. The namespace of 使用模组 (means "using modding") which is translated inappropriately has been moved to 模组 (means "modding"). I had created two pages 模组:使用指南/header and 模组:物品数据 before changing namespace, but now these two pages are gone. They are still under the namespace Main, and can be searched using the search bar. Is there any way to recover these two pages other than copying the content directly from stardewcommunitywiki.com ?
2. I have to asking for moving my bot account Horizon Bot into Bots Group again. Katzeus helped move the account: User\_talk:Katzeus.
3. The links of 苹果酒森林 (Cindersap Forest) and 冒险家公会 (Adventurer's Guild) on the Chinese main page need to be updated to 煤矿森林 and 探险家公会 according to the translation in the game.
4. I used to ask Margotbean for help on Chinese wiki (really thanks for his help), but I have noticed that he is not in the administrator group now. Does this means that I have to post on this page when I meet other problems in the future?
5. The page Help:编辑入门(Help:Editing) could be re-added to the Chinese main page. Margotbean helped add this link before: User\_talk:Katzeus

Code  `| id="mainbannermiddle" width="40%" style="padding: 9px; text-align:center; margin:1px;" |[[File:Main_Logo_ZH.png|center|link=]]<span style="font-size:22px; font-weight:bold;">欢迎来到[[Stardew Valley]] Wiki</span> 由玩家自发维护和更新，任何人都可以编辑！您可以参考[[帮助:编辑入门]]来参与编辑。 我们目前有[[Special:Statistics|{{NUMBEROFARTICLES}}篇]]关于由[[ConcernedApe]]开发的星露谷物语的词条。`

Besides these, I want to know why the talk pages, user\_talk pages and user pages are not transfered to this site? Does every user have to copy their old pages manually? Thanks ! Horizon98 (talk) 11:02, 19 February 2021 (UTC)

Hello Horizon! I created the pages for #1, but you may have to mark the pages in the Main namespace for deletion (I searched for them but didn't find them, maybe you will have better luck!)

ColitoCole will have to give your bot the appropriate group rights, I don't seem to have that ability.

Cole and I are discussing how to handle the help page. It might go in the left sidebar instead of on the main page. It might need to be rewritten also. Unfortunately, I have to ask for your patience on that one.

User talk pages have to be moved manually, yes. Your old talk page is here: https://zh.stardewcommunitywiki.com/User\_talk:Horizon98

At the moment, I can't edit Template:Mainmenu to change the links, but we're working on it.

Good to see you on the new wiki! margotbean (talk) 18:24, 19 February 2021 (UTC)

Thanks for all you have done! But 模组:使用指南/header and 模组:物品数据 are both under the Main namespace as well as the Modding namespace now. I don't know how to remove them from the Main namespace. Maybe there are two pages using the same title, and the page under the Main namespace is hidden. You can find them listed as the second and the third one from this link. Horizon98 (talk) 05:22, 20 February 2021 (UTC)

The tech people are working on it! Thanks for reporting these odd events, please keep doing so! margotbean (talk) 06:51, 21 February 2021 (UTC)

## Nintendo Switch version of the game

I noticed that the Nintendo Switch version is missing on the main page and I was wondering if that is on purpose or on accident —Uhdoro (talk) 12:02, 21 February 2021‎ (UTC)

It's there for me. Are you seeing something different? —Pathoschild (talk) 17:40, 21 February 2021 (UTC)

## Website Malfunction Database Problem

For the last 2 or 3 days certain wiki pages keep malfunctioning, displaying an error instead of the expected page. It was just happening again about an hour ago, but of course I can't replicate the problem right now when I want to copy/paste the exact error. The error says something about the database not working. It does seem to be pages that might want to load data which are affected (like specific item pages, eg. sap or oyster), so that makes sense. When it starts happening, it generally keeps happening and refreshing the page a few minutes later or trying a different item does not work.

If it happens again I'll try to edit this (first time user, but I assume I can edit... I'll "rtfm" later) with the error details. I'm fairly new to Stardew Valley and am referencing this site a \_lot\_... do you want me to keep updating this to let you know when it's down (or "PM" someone or something?). If this is a common occurrence for you and there's a big red "Restart Database" button you have somewhere that you press when it messes up, I would be willing to press it for you whenever I see that error start happening if that would be useful for you. Thank you for your great and useful wiki! Maxxie (talk) 02:07, 28 February 2021 (UTC)

Update: it's happening again. Here is the error I'm getting right now: Sorry! This site is experiencing technical difficulties. Try waiting a few minutes and reloading. (Cannot access the database)

That's all it shows, that text on a white background.

Interesting note: I just did view page source on it, and I see the source for the page that should be showing up. This can be used as a workaround for now for users like me to still access some of the information we're after even when it's erroring. Maxxie (talk) 05:20, 28 February 2021 (UTC)

I can reproduce this, e.g. with the Fall page. Signed in as a user: No issues. Signed out: always white page "Sorry! This site is experiencing technical difficulties. Try waiting a few minutes and reloading. (Cannot access the database)" Tested on multiple browsers and on 2 different internet connections - same result Dubesor (talk) 05:53, 28 February 2021 (UTC)

Try clearing your browser's cache (Ctrl+F5) or by going to "History" and clearing browsing data, and see if the problem persists. Please report back if this doesn't fix the issue. margotbean (talk) 20:17, 28 February 2021 (UTC)

cleared cache (one of my browser is set to reset everything on close anyways) and issue persists. This is an issue with certain pages only (I can reproduce always on: Fall, Sam, Ginger Island, Calendar for example) and is reported by several people (e.g. reddit). This issue was never present on the old wiki. Dubesor (talk) 21:07, 28 February 2021 (UTC)

OK, the server people are going to look into it. Thanks for reporting this issue! margotbean (talk) 21:23, 28 February 2021 (UTC)

For users experiencing this problem: **The workaround is to add "?action=purge" to the end of the url, then click "ok" to purge cache**. The page should display normally. --margotbean (talk) 21:38, 28 February 2021 (UTC)

## Sebastian's page formatting in his gift preferences is messed up as of the last few edits

just as it says in title

The page for Marnie's info doesn't work

Looks like some recent incorrect edits on the Sebastian page have been reverted, and should be back to normal. I don't see any issues on Marnie's page. If you're referring to an issue where the page isn't loading, here's a comment on resolving that: *For users experiencing this problem: The workaround is to add* `?action=purge` *to the end of the url, then click "ok" to purge cache. The page should display normally.* - Odin (talk) 14:16, 13 March 2021 (UTC)

## Wiki's name in other languages (About SEO)

When I search the keyword "`site:zh.stardewvalleywiki.com`" on most popular search engine Baidu in China, there are only 13 results. While on the second popular search engine (maybe) Bing in China, there are 16,900 results. And Google doesn't provide service in China. So I will use Bing in the following part. Usually, we search the keyword like `"<Translated name of Stardew Valley> + <Translated keyword> (such as 收集包 (Bundles) )"`. In this situation, there's no result from this site in the first few pages. But when I search the keyword like `"stardew valley + <Translated keyword>"`, this site's page is the first or the second result usually. Therefore, I propose this is beacause the translated name of stardew valley is not contained in the page. Maybe changing the sitename in other languages to `"<translated name of the game> + <translated name of wiki>"` or `"Stardew Valley Wiki | <translated name of the game> + <translated name of wiki>"` has better SEO performence in search engines. Horizon98 (talk) 12:24, 20 March 2021 (UTC)

I've translated the name of the game and the word "wiki" in zh:Template:InfoboxSEO. Let's see if that helps! margotbean (talk) 18:27, 20 March 2021 (UTC)

I believe the SEO issue in China is due to lack of external linking (references). This is not something we can help much, though. iBugOne (talk) 8:13, 21 March 2021 (UTC)

I tried to search some keywords with bing today. Here's the results:

when I searched the keyword "星露谷 社区中心" (means "Stardew Valley Community Center"), zh:社区中心 (means Community Center) whose pagename is "&lt;translatedname of Community Center&gt; + &lt;translated name of the game&gt; + &lt;translated name of wiki&gt;" is listed as the third.

While I searched the keyword "星露谷 姜岛" (means "Stardew Valley Ginger Island"), I couldn't found any results from this wiki in the first few pages. The pagename of zh:姜岛 (means Ginger Island) is now "&lt;translatedname of Ginger Island&gt; + Stardew Valley Wiki". (Because the page doesn't use the template InfoboxSEO.) But I found some results from this wiki in the 4th page: zh:姜岛图腾柱 (means Island Obelisk) and zh:岛屿办事处 (means Island Field Office) which both use the template InfoboxSEO.

Searching the keyword "星露谷 收集包" (means "Stardew Valley Bundles"), the first result from this page is zh:社区中心 (means Community Center). As far as I'm concerned, it's the same reason as the second keyword. zh:收集包 doesn't use the template InfoboxSEO too.

I don't know whether the sitename of the page or the keywords in the template InfoboxSEO influences the results of the search engines. Thus, could you try to change the sitename of the whole Chinese wiki? Thanks! Horizon98 (talk) 09:22, 9 April 2021 (UTC)

I will talk with the server people about possible solutions to this problem. Thanks for reporting and providing links! We'll see what we can do to make the official wiki the 1st search result. margotbean (talk) 17:40, 9 April 2021 (UTC)

## Old Wiki

Hi. I am Giles, formerly Butterbur. I have spent three months unavoidably separated from this Wiki, and returned to find a new Wiki, sans my user pages. Is the old wiki, or an archive of it, still available so that I can retrieve a few things? Giles (talk) 02:17, 30 March 2021 (UTC)

The old wiki is located at: https://stardewcommunitywiki.com/Stardew\_Valley\_Wiki

Welcome back! margotbean (talk) 02:50, 30 March 2021 (UTC)

Thanks much! Good to be back! Giles (talk) 02:56, 30 March 2021 (UTC)

Also worth mentioning that you can transfer your watchlist with this script: https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User:Pathoschild/Transfer\_watchlist. - Odin (talk) 16:45, 30 March 2021 (UTC)

Thanks for your thoughtfulness, Odin. I'm not familiar with the console, though, and it seems not to work for me. Giles (talk) 20:10, 3 April 2021 (UTC)

## Image files not updating

I tried updating 2 images File:Walnutroutetosimonsays.PNG and File:Walnuthiddennorthsouthpassage.PNG, I received no error and the entry shows the file size of the new image, however thumbnail as well as image remained the same as if it's still the previous version. Is this user error or something on the server's end? I tried purging my cache and tested between 3 browsers (Firefox, Brave and Chrome) and the issue is replicated on each one (for viewing, not for uploading - I don't want to spam retry). Dubesor (talk) 10:45, 9 April 2021 (UTC)

I've had this problem before, in fact it just takes a while to update. JaksStrange (talk) 14:08, 9 April 2021 (UTC)

Ah, I see. It's updated now, so it was just slow servers after all (took about ~5 hours for it to update). Thanks for the info, I wasn't sure if it was me or not. Dubesor (talk) 14:14, 9 April 2021 (UTC)

It's not just you for sure, I've had the same problem, and am reporting it again to the server people to see if there's a new problem causing this. I thought we had it fixed, but apparently not. Thanks for posting the messages, though! margotbean (talk) 17:38, 9 April 2021 (UTC)

Can confirm that the problem is still occurring. Several weird things about it:

1. I can see the new version's thumbnail, but trying to view the full file shows the original version.
2. The image's page indicates I'm not logged in and has a message saying I can't overwrite it, even while I'm logged in on other pages.
3. The server definitely knows about the new version. In trying to fix the issue myself, I tried to upload the image again as an entirely new file under a different name, and it gave me an error about being a duplicate.

Bladeoflight16 (talk) 19:03, 13 May 2021 (UTC)

The problem with images not updating for several hours is one that I don't think we can fix. The server people tell me it's a problem of waiting for the job queue to get around to them. The problem with the images showing you as not logged in is affecting me and the server people as well. That's a problem they're looking into, as that shouldn't happen! margotbean (talk) 19:45, 13 May 2021 (UTC)

## Cargo Tables

I see that the cargo plugin is installed; It would be nice if some cargo templates/tables were created, as I'd like to make an API for Stardew information. Micalobia (talk) 19:40, 18 April 2021 (UTC)

Yes, the extension is installed, but unfortunately we can't use it until we solve the problem of importing data into 11 other languages. margotbean (talk) 20:11, 18 April 2021 (UTC)

As in, have tables handle other languages, or just the wiki itself needs more fletched out languages? Micalobia (talk) 01:57, 21 April 2021 (UTC)

Other languages cannot query cargo tables created on the English wiki, so creating cargo table here would break all the other wikis. margotbean (talk) 17:52, 21 April 2021 (UTC)

Forgive me if I'm misunderstanding or being naive, but would it be possible to create a root table that holds language-neutral info about something, then create other tables that hold language-sensitive data, and prefix them with \`de\` for Germen, etc., using a language-neutral identifier for joining tables in queries? Also, if there's somewhere better like a Discord or otherwise to talk about this instead of the noticeboard, let me know, this was all I could find.Micalobia (talk) 08:04, 26 April 2021 (UTC)

It might be possible to create the kinds of tables you describe, but they would have to be manually copied to up to 11 other languages, for each page where they're used. The queries would have to be customized for each language, to call the correct prefix. And after all that, it would probably still be necessary to create a template to style the info queried from the table. margotbean (talk) 16:04, 26 April 2021 (UTC)

Not impossible to do, I can definitely understand the hesitation though. If there's anything I can do to help work towards that kind of goal, I'm willing to help a lot with it, as there's not really a better idea to work around the languages that come to mind. Handling the separate languages on the query side of things wouldn't be hard to work around, especially with a wrapper that would take something as simple as a URL or header parameter to select a language. Micalobia (talk) 04:42, 30 April 2021 (UTC)

I'm not sure how languages work in MediaWiki exactly since I only work English game wikis, and this question/suggestion doesn't help at all with wanting an API, but would DynamicPageLlist3 extension ever be enabled on this wiki for the creation of automated data tables? We (another game wiki--standalone MW install) use it for pulling infobox template parameter values of pages in certain categories into dynamic data tables that we can then format via surrogate templates, perform parser functions on per line, etc to create sortable, self-updating data tables... so say, to compile a table of all farmed foods: their name, cost, sewing time, season, profit etc (whatever common parameter names and values are contained in their common templates for a given category can be pulled into a table, formatted, calculated/parsed with necessary icons etc and made sortable). There are many creative uses for DPL3, including random images, galleries, data tables etc. Perhaps then only the words used in the DPL statement to generate a table on a given page need changing. When I view an other language page, it looks like a separate and distinct page with separate and distinct categories, so it would seem like a DPL statement required to call a data table would be easily adapted to the different languages.

DPL3 is now maintained by a dev over at Miraheze wiki farm (they have a large user base so should be stable enough). It does not make or require database changes (no need to run update script via SSH) like Cargo does, and thus can be activated and deactivated easily without long-term consequence or maintenance burden, though it is more limited (and functional richness should intentionally be limited to 4, not 5 its full functional richness). It seems to work fine with special characters and other languages (I think), though there are some resource expensive functions that should be avoided, its ability to create self-updating, aggregated data tables from infobox parameter values is exceptionally nice if one can't do a full solution like Cargo. I have used DPL3 a fair bit, so am curious if this was considered in lieu of cargo. Or if they would consider installing it for examples/testing. If they were, I'd be happy to help out with examples on how to use it, since its documentation isn't ideal. Thanks Username\_Removed (talk) 08:35, 20 June 2021 (UTC)

Not at this time, but I'll keep your offer in mind, thank you. margotbean (talk) 18:34, 20 June 2021 (UTC)

Thanks for confirming Margotbean, I thought this was probably the case but figured I'd ask anyhow, just in case. I can play with MW data displays off-site for this. Thanks for the reply. Cheers Username\_Removed (talk) 21:48, 20 June 2021 (UTC)

A year since this was discussed, but figured I'd pipe up with an opinion. I've converted a couple of large wikis to use Cargo, on Gamepedia wikis (before it was killed off/eaten), and it was quite honestly a monumental task. Ideally it's something you plan for from the get-go, so for a wiki like this, which is kinda "complete" or very mature, it's not something I would really recommend. There are also benefits with a "static" wiki. Admittedly more troublesome when many things change, because you can't change a value one place (db) and then all pages are automatically updated. But in this case that is unlikely to become an issue, and a benefit with static pages (from my brief looks) is that you don't run into the potential issue of pages "breaking" due to issues with the database, or duplicate values/rows and suchlike, which at least was a problem with Cargo in the past. Pangaea (talk) 13:50, 1 September 2022 (UTC)

## Page on Time

I'd like to have / contribute to a more comprehensive page on how time behaves in SDV. With a focus on differences between single- and multiplayer.  
Ideally it would also include somewhat detailed information on what actions are and aren't possible during /pause.

Day Cycle wouldn't be suitable, as it's very much a beginners' guide and the resource would only be useful if it included spoilers e.g. the Skull Caves, Festivals.

Basically I'm asking: where in this wiki (if at all) would be the place for this page? --Choccylatte (talk) 19:16, 8 May 2021 (UTC)

You could create a section called "Time" on the Multiplayer page, under "Features", that could include detailed info about /pause. Similarly, you could create a section on the Day Cycle page (called "Caveats"? "Exceptions"? ...your choice) that would summarize exceptions to the rules listed there. I think it would be best to modify the 2 existing pages rather than create a new page that would include duplicate info. The Day Cycle page doesn't have to remain an abbreviated beginner's guide at all, it can (and should) include all info about time and the day cycle in the game! margotbean (talk) 19:35, 8 May 2021 (UTC)

Sounds good! I've added a section Multiplayer#Features##Time that could use a little polishing but (I hope) correctly summarized all the information I have. As it has been quite a while since when I last played singleplayer, I haven't touched Day Cycle yet. --Choccylatte (talk) 23:59, 8 May 2021 (UTC)

The Multiplayer page looks perfect, thank you on behalf of all stardew players! margotbean (talk) 00:37, 9 May 2021 (UTC)

## Can't edit a page

Hello. I am trying to add a table with a comparison of all crops to Crops page. I'm getting the following errors:

- This action has been automatically identified as harmful, and therefore disallowed.
- If you believe your action was constructive, please inform an administrator of what you were trying to do. A brief description of the abuse rule which your action matched is: Spam Keywords
- This action has been automatically identified as harmful, and therefore disallowed.
- If you believe your action was constructive, please inform an administrator of what you were trying to do. A brief description of the abuse rule which your action matched is: Mass edit by new user

I think that this happens because it's a big edit, and because the word "Price" is used many times.

Also, the error box is hidden by default and you need to inspect element to make it visible.

Kelenius (talk) 11:42, 25 May 2021 (UTC)

Thanks for the info about the errorbox, I can fix that today. As for the crops table, that info is on the seasonal pages already. margotbean (talk) 17:54, 25 May 2021 (UTC)

## Term inconsistency, common sense redirects, style guide

I've noticed in some places the term "farm maps" is used and in other places the term "farm layout" is used (which is more accurate, and is descriptive of what a user finds since the layouts are not maps). A redirect I created from "Farms" (to accommodate for the term choice I see as confusing) to Farm Maps was deleted. To my knowledge, there is only one actual map in the game and the wiki pages are usually based on proper game terms. The map tab in user settings has way-finding markings/labels on it--that to me is a map. I added the "Farms" redirect because as a new user, I'd never search "Farm Maps" for different farms or farm *layouts*. I tend to think it would be nice to help other new users with redirects for some common sense terms (the deletion of this redirect did not make good sense, its logic was sound). Does anyone go through the server logs regularly to determine which terms are most searched for (not including autocomplete partial results) that don't have pages and/or redirects, in order to help new users, and use this to create those redirects supported by some access log data? This would probably be very helpful and is fairly common. To be fair, it may be difficult for experienced wiki users already familiar with existing page titles, to be impartial as to what a new user would consider to be a helpful or needed redirect. In my opinion, that’s what fresh eyes can be good for sometimes. Perhaps you won't agree though, and that's fine. :)

Also, is there a style guide somewhere off-wiki? I notice that proper titles/terms for game items are sometimes capitalized and other times not, which does this wiki prefer? Even just a line about this on the guide page can add a very helpful thing for less experienced editors to pitch in on to help. Some wikis create a checklist of these consistency items that users find very helpful. Might be a nice addition?

Username\_Removed (talk) 22:58, 3 July 2021 (UTC)

Okay, now valid spoiler tags are being removed also, though the help editing page still says to add them (sorry but this is confusing for users attempting to help). Perhaps you could elaborate there on when and when not to add these, or remove that text if you no longer want content marked as spoiler? Maybe the 1.5 update for mobile might drop sooner than I think and perhaps this is the reason, if so that makes sense. The edit reversal comment said someone has to remove them all one day, as the reason for reversal. There is an easy way to determine and do that when the time comes by adding a parser function to the spoiler template that auto-categorizes (temporarily) any page that uses that template to its update number... then edit each page to remove them all (90% were already done before I came along, I'd have been happy to do it when the time comes, though seems like I may have outstayed my helpfulness here), then remove the parser function that auto-categorizes when done. Half pages spoilered and half not was very confusing for me as a new player. I think you guys are wanting less editing help than I thought, wanting to do most of it yourselves, understandable. Cheers.

Ah, you're only undoing the ones I did, okay, good enough. Please delete and or rename my user account and personal data in the database on this wiki, thank you. Here is a guide on how this is done, **please pass on to server admins per data privacy**: GDPR and Mediawiki.

Username\_Removed (talk) 04:33, 4 July 2021 (UTC)

Hi, Username\_Removed! I don't know why margotbean reversed all your edits. But there should be a much easier way to remove the template when the day comes: Special:Replacetext. This special page can only be used by admin. So the admin can remove the text "{{Spoiler}}" on all pages easily. You can see the sever admin User:Prod did that from his contributions. Thanks for your all of your work here. Best regards😊. Horizon98 (talk) 08:50, 4 July 2021 (UTC)

Ah, I didn’t realize that extension was installed since so many other MW 1.5 bundled extensions here are not, nor are the ones that facilitate easier translation. I should have visited the Version page to double-check. FYI the Help:Editing guide still says to spoiler pages, after pointing this out it is still not removed in the guide, none of my posts were replied to, and others have recently and have not had theirs reversed, so I can only assume it is related to my person and/or my suggestions, which had solid logic and utility. There are other wikis and offline export that's easy to set up, thanks, you're welcome, and cheers! Username\_Removed (talk) 23:53, 4 July 2021 (UTC)

## Css on login page via config setting

Please (Wiki bureaucrat/Sysop with access to LocalSettings.php config), please look up in the MW manual and consider setting`$wgAllowSiteCSSOnRestrictedPages = true;` in LocalSettings.php, so the login (and other) special pages use the site-wide css as well, it looks strange to be dumped to the white default Vector CSS for sign up, login, preferences and such. It is an easy change we use on our wikis. Thanks! Username\_Removed (talk) 19:28, 25 July 2021 (UTC)

## Interwiki transcluding

I want to translate Modding:Mod compatibility to Chinese wiki, but it's updated frequently. As far as I'm concerned, transclude part of this page can be a potential way. However, `{{#lst}}` doesn't support interwiki references. And then I found that `$wgEnableScaryTranscluding` feature of Mediawiki could solve this problem possibly (*see also:Reasonably efficient interwiki transclusion*), while stardew valley wiki hasn't enabled the feature. Is there other way to solve this problem? Thanks. --Horizon98 (Discussion) 02:21, 26 August 2021 (UTC)

## Suggestion for improving goodwill and atmosphere

Before I exit for good, I wanted to add a potentially helpful suggestion, since I saw some atmosphere discussion elsewhere. There is an excellent extension for promoting goodwill and a positive atmosphere on a wiki, it is called **Thanks** (it requires the Echo extension, which is also **very** useful to users, providing enhanced notifications). The **Thanks** extension allows both users and admins to give thanks and show appreciation for efforts on helpful edits. Such an extension could help to offset the tone of hurried, "brief, or blunt" (quoting Cole) admin actions, by supplementing it with some highly positive and appreciative ones that are a quick, easy click while reviewing changes/diffs. Having such a feature is a great way to help foster a community atmosphere, and I'd imagine it is why it is used on Wikimedia/Wikipedia projects. I install both on the wikis I work on, as I find it has a very beneficial effect on atmosphere. Good luck and cheers! :) - Username\_Removed (talk) 13:26, 26 August 2021 (UTC)

Thank you for this suggestion, I will investigate! ColitoCole (talk) 15:59, 26 August 2021 (UTC)

You're welcome, thanks for replying and investigating it. Username\_Removed (talk) 19:58, 26 August 2021 (UTC)

Also, when you have some time Cole, can you please review Talk:Dyeing since the page is clearly incorrect and confusing in places but was left unaddressed, thanks. Username\_Removed (talk) 20:50, 26 August 2021 (UTC)

I will take a look as soon as I can! :) ColitoCole (talk) 19:35, 30 August 2021 (UTC)

## Creating &amp; Sharing a pdf version of the wiki

I have time and tools to undertake the former part of this project but would the mods mind if i share a downloadable version of the wiki on the reddit/wiki/discord? \`\`\`\`PhyscoDec (talk) 04:25, 07/10/2021

It's very nice of you to ask permission! However, as long as you reference the source (https://stardewvalleywiki.com), you can redistribute the content at will, according to the rules outlined at Stardew Valley Wiki:Copyrights. Good luck to you! margotbean (talk) 18:55, 7 September 2021 (UTC)

## Can't add links as new account

I wanted to add a note to the Version History page mentioning the reversion and subsequent re-release of 1.5.5 hotfix 3, with a link to ConcernedApe's Twitter. Since my account is new and it contained an external link, I couldn't. I came over here to request that someone with higher trust add it, but I made the mistake of including the link in that comment too, so it wouldn't let me add it here. Would someone mind adding a short sentence about that over on that page? Eiim (talk) 16:34, 8 December 2021 (UTC)

Sure, I will add that in. User314159 (talk) 17:42, 8 December 2021 (UTC)

Thanks! Eiim (talk) 17:50, 8 December 2021 (UTC)

## Search terms and page titles are case-sensitive. Redirect?

If you search for a page using the built-in search engine, you need to type in the exact title of the article, with all but the first letter being case-sensitive. So for example, if you search for "qi gem", you won't be sent to Qi Gem, because the "G" in the title is capitalized (the "Q" can be uppercase or lowercase). Similarly, you can link to Qi Gem and qi Gem but not Qi gem or qi gem.  
This is a technical limitation in the MediaWiki software. Wikipedia (en.wikipedia.org) gets around it by making redirects for any reasonable variant of a page title people might search for. That might seem a little clunky, and indeed, the English Wikipedia has millions of redirects as a result, but it's good enough for them, and they're one of the top-ten websites in the world.  
I couldn't find anything definitive on whether or not we want redirects for alternative spellings and capitalization, just a few comments from last year on the old wiki.  
Salaereus (talk) 22:58, 8 December 2021 (UTC)

Something like TitleKey can solve the search bar issue. I've tried that extension on a MediaWiki installation myself and it lets you type in all lowercase in the search bar and the results will be correctly listed. The English Wikipedia doesn't use it because it causes unintended behaviors but for this wiki it should be fine.--Spaceeinstein (talk) 00:24, 9 December 2021 (UTC)

When you search for "qi gem" the first result on the "Search Results" page is Qi Gem. So, mediawiki adds one extra click, but it gets you there. I will pass on the info. about TitleKey to the server people. Thanks, margotbean (talk) 20:04, 9 December 2021 (UTC)

I'll be honest, I often don't bother to hit enter on a search, so something like TitleKey would be a huge QoL improvement for the wiki. I think a lot of people would fine it useful, and I know this discussion has come up a few different times in the past, so there's definitely interest. - Odin (talk) 15:25, 12 December 2021 (UTC)

I'm interested as well! The main problem is the 3rd "known problem" listed at the bottom of the TitleKey page -- "it breaks search suggestions for pages that are not in the main namespace". Unless and until we upgrade to MediaWiki 1.36+, the extension would break all searches for templates and in the "Modding" namespace. margotbean (talk) 18:39, 12 December 2021 (UTC)

## Cannot add external link

I wanted to add a link to the external tool "Stardew Profits" (thanks User:Charly for the tip), but this is flagged as "harmful" / "abuse". This is very unwelcoming! Can someone a) change the anti-abuse filters to not trigger on good-faith contributions and b) add this external link to the Crops page? I had the following in mind. ===Gold per Day=== :''See also: \[https://thorinair.github.io/Stardew-Profits/ Stardew Profits] (external tool)'' Calculations do not take into account … --Odg (talk) 01:15, 11 December 2021 (UTC)

I've added the link per the discussion on the Crops talk page. If you have any ideas about how an abuse filter can distinguish between good faith external links and bad faith external links, I'm all ears! margotbean (talk) 01:46, 11 December 2021 (UTC)

Thank you for the helpful response. I have two ideas: 1) simply change the message phrasing from "…identified as harmful…" to something along the lines of "sorry, we only allow admins to add external links, please ask here (link to noticeboard)". Same result, but much friendlier / more helpful. 2) require login and/or captcha when adding external link. Manual: https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Combating\_spam .

I think the restriction of adding external links is exclusive to new members. Afterwards any member can add them, not just admins. I think once one becomes "semi-confirmed" (at least 10 edits and account at least 4 days old, at least according to Wikipedia) the external link restriction goes away.

## Issues uploading new versions of a picture?

I've been trying to update the IDE reference, and for some reason, it won't actually let me update the picture itself. It keeps on going back to a corrupted version of the first version and I can't figure out why. For here (https://stardewvalleywiki.com/File:Modding\_-\_IDE\_reference\_-\_change\_target\_framework\_(Visual\_Studio\_2).png), for example, the sequence of events: upload picture. Try to upload picture again, get told that it's a direct copy of what the wiki already has. Awkwardly recrop image to try to get around that, see that the old version file now matches what I expect it to be. Try reverting to that one, but now the "latest version" has gone back to being the wrong file, despite being a revert to image the second-oldest file. Atravita (talk) 19:56, 16 December 2021 (UTC)

Hi Atravita, I've responded on your talk page, but the solution is to upload or revert to the correct version that you want, and then wait up to 5 hours. It may take that long for the correct image to show on the page(s) where it's used. Unfortunately, this can't be fixed (I've tried). margotbean (talk) 20:01, 16 December 2021 (UTC)

Thanks! I'll be patient :) Atravita (talk) 22:41, 16 December 2021 (UTC)

## Translating this wiki to Thai

Actually, Thai language wiki does exist (https://stardewvalleywikithai.com/) but it is unofficial wiki and only admins can edit (not sure whether the wiki uses Mediawiki or not). What should I do? Regards --Just Monika (talk) 06:40, 3 January 2022 (UTC)

Hi Monika! Unfortunately, I can't give you any advice about editing unofficial wikis. Several unofficial wikis for Stardew Valley exist, including wikis in languages that have official wikis. You have to decide for yourself if you want to get involved with them. Use your best judgement, and good luck to you! margotbean (talk) 14:16, 3 January 2022 (UTC)

## New Mail Page?

I was recently trying to see all of the items that villagers could send you in the mail and realized there was no centralized page for mail. I was able to find the info I needed by going through each villager, but I think having a centralized "Mail" page could be helpful for a number of reasons. This page would include basic info about the mail system, as well as info on what letters you can receive, what triggers them, etc. This would include quest letters, letters from mom and dad, villager gifts, etc. Most of this info is available on some page on the wiki, but it's not organized super well. I can create the page and populate out much of it, but before I went through the effort I wanted to make sure that creating a page for this would be okay and my work wasn't going to just get undone. Also, the Help Editing page isn't super clear about the guidelines on adding a page, so I'm not sure when it is appropriate to create a new page or not. Squigs44 (talk) 02:38, 9 February 2022 (UTC)

Hi Squigs! Discussion before making large changes is always a good idea. Regarding a "Mail" page -- to be honest, it sounds like a *lot* of duplication of info. A disambiguation page might be more appropriate. What info about the mail system in general do you think is missing from the wiki? Is this something that can be summarized on Collections#Letters? margotbean (talk) 17:45, 9 February 2022 (UTC)

I don't think it's the fact that info is missing from the wiki that is the problem, but more of the fact that you have to actually search even deeper than just a mail page to get information regarding a specific mail. It would also be good for new &amp; developing players to know exactly what kind of mail they can expect to get, otherwise they will only be able to look up the ones that they already got. Now that I think about it, I think having a "cutscenes" page would also be nice, or at least putting all of the cutscenes in the pages for the locations it takes place in. User314159 (talk) 21:57, 9 February 2022 (UTC)

Yes, a lot of mail information is present on the wiki already. However, this information is spread across at least 40 or 50 different pages, sometimes as a one sentence entry as part of a large page. Trying to find that information right now requires you to know exactly what you are looking for. Some of the letters are briefly mentioned, but don't include the actual text of the letter, so that information is missing. There are a few letters that I couldn't find on the wiki, such as the letter that informs you that you will be "featured in next week's 'up &amp; coming' column of the Stardew Valley Tribune!" as one example. So the main thing would be consolidating information from 40+ pages into one spot, but also we would have a nice spot to add in new information that is not present. It could also feature a trivia section about letters present in the game code that were never implemented (there is a letter about stardew hero rankings that was never implemented, along with a few others). I don't think the collections section on letters would be a good spot for all of this. There are already several places on the wiki where information is duplicated across pages - for example, I can read about Robin liking Hardwood on the Friendship Page, on Robins Page, and on the Hardwood Page. We have that information in multiple places because people might search Robin wanting to know what gifts they need, or they might search Hardwood wanting to know what uses it has. Likewise, I think having a landing spot for people searching about mail might be beneficial. Ultimately I will do whatever the admins want, but personally I think a mail page would add value to the wiki. Squigs44 (talk) 02:07, 10 February 2022 (UTC)

Hi Squigs - I don't disagree with everything you said, but I was asking a specific question ("What info about the mail system in general do you think is missing from the wiki") that you haven't answered.

Why don't you create a mockup in your user space, and see how the project goes. Feel out the scope of it, what information you'd like it to have, and how it might be organized. Then we can better assess exactly what we're dealing with, rather than discussing in the abstract.

Just by the by, if you search for "stardew valley tribune", the only search result is Gold, where you can find the text of the letter you mentioned. Good luck! margotbean (talk) 17:27, 10 February 2022 (UTC)

## Improve deletion template?

What do you think of simplifying and improving Template:Delete? I think the format is hard to read, and I always feel bad about slapping a *this is the worst page I've ever seen* banner on a user's legitimate contribution that's no longer needed (like an unused image).

Here's how it looks now for reference:

“ “This is the worst page I've ever seen!” — George

Last edited by Pathoschild on 2022-03-06 18:19:33.

I was thinking something pretty simple that reuses the same text, so it's easy to update in other languages. Maybe something like this as a rough draft?

—Pathoschild (talk) 18:42, 6 March 2022 (UTC)

No, no, a thousand times no. I'm sorry, I think "worst page.." is harsh as well, but so is George. Right now, the format matches the other templates, and I don't want that to change. Any text changes also have to be translated into 11 other languages. And, the template isn't meant to be around for any length of time, it shouldn't be seen for more than a day unless I have the flu or a broken leg.

I'm honestly more concerned with the mass of redlinks on the Turkish multiplayer page caused by the modding non-template Modding:Console commands/cmd atm. Again, I'm sorry, but it's a firm "no" this time. margotbean (talk) 18:57, 6 March 2022 (UTC)

## Wiki in Ukrainian

I want to translate Stardew Valley Wiki to Ukrainian language. This has much sense for me and thousands of Ukrainian Stardew Valley players for now and for future. What should I do to start creating of new pages? Is there any procedure to become a translator on the resource? Olesia (talk) 12:16, 23 March 2022

I'm sorry, but the official wiki only supports languages from the game. Since the game hasn't been translated into Ukranian, the wiki doesn't have a Ukranian version. You can contact ConcernedApe and request an official translation in the game (his contact details are on the official website). Thanks for your interest! margotbean (talk) 17:20, 23 March 2022 (UTC)

## Map template with clickable links

Hello, I created a map template with links on all the relevant locations (Link to it).

Now the links are shown with red boxes, so you can see were they are. The template should work like the template in the page Shipping Bin, where a red border appears when you hover. I've written CSS to make it work like I described at User:Samu698/Sandbox/Template Map/styles.css, but i cannot use it because the page must have model content set to "Sanitized CSS"

To implement this in the wiki the links should be internationalized because the page names are different in different languages (How do I do it?).

PS: Sorry User:Margotbean for causing problems with the categories and the SEO in my sandbox Samu698 (talk) 21:51, 28 June 2022 (UTC)

A couple of things -- couldn't this be achieved more easily with the `<map>` tag? Also, the links should be blue when hovering, not red. Finally, where were you thinking of using this map? Thanks, margotbean (talk) 02:28, 29 June 2022 (UTC)

I could use the map tag, but it has a few problems 1. you can't use percentages with it so the link position dosen't change with the image size. 2. I'm not sure how to make the box appear with the map tag 3. it would be about the same amount of code.

You are right about the color of the links, i'll make then blue.

The map should replace the template:Map which is used in the template:Infobox location Samu698 (talk) 07:19, 29 June 2022 (UTC)

Template:Map already has a little avatar head to indicate the location(s). It's also used on all 69 fish pages as well as the location pages. And the pages already have links to the locations in the text. So, I'm just not seeing the benefit of making these changes, I'm afraid. margotbean (talk) 15:55, 29 June 2022 (UTC)

The template would be useful for the Template:infobox location, allowing user to click on the map instead of typing the name of a location to find info about it.

the links on the map could be enabled only for the infobox using a template parameter (like links=1). This way the maps in the fish pages don't get links. Samu698 (talk) 16:43, 29 June 2022 (UTC)

No one should have to type to find the location of a building that uses Infobox location, there should be a link in the "Address" field or the body of the page. If there isn't, we can fix that. I'm sorry, you did some impressive css work, really, but I don't think the benefits outweigh the number of changes that would have to be made across all 12 languages. margotbean (talk) 17:08, 29 June 2022 (UTC)

Last time I try to convince you, if you find this change not worth it I understand it and I'll stop.

I think you misunderstood me when I said that you can find a location without typing. I meant that you can click the map to see any other location that the one referenced by the infobox. For example if you are in page for the Mines you can easily click the map to go to the page for the farmhouse.

The number of changes to be made are 36, three per language, one on Template:Map/styles.css that would require just copying the CSS I wrote, one on Template:Map that would require translating the links of the locations, and one on Template:infobox\_location to enable the links on the map. If the changes are done in this order no page will break and the links would be rolled out to the whole wiki.

If you give me the go ahead I will translate the links for all the wikis and then I can make the change in a couple of hours. Samu698 (talk) 21:00, 29 June 2022 (UTC)

Still no, I'm afraid. There has been a request in the past, however, to add links to the large images on the Cindersap Forest and Pelican Town pages. Would you be interested in that project? These would be new templates that would replace the images currently on the page. What do you think? margotbean (talk) 13:20, 30 June 2022 (UTC)

Ok i can do that! give me 2-3 days and I will be done with at least one of the images Samu698 (talk) 14:26, 30 June 2022 (UTC)

## Pelican Town Map

I created a new topic because the previous one was getting too indented :]. As you requested I created the Pelican town map template. This is a temporary version with the links shown, to make it work as intended it requires some CSS in a styles.css page that doesn't work in the sandbox due to content model problems. Samu698 (talk) 11:15, 4 July 2022 (UTC)

Very nice! Go ahead and create the template as Template:Pelican Town Map, and we can iron out the CSS problems in the template namespace. margotbean (talk) 14:04, 4 July 2022 (UTC)

Ok, I added the template for the English wiki it seems to work, if there are any problems tell me in my talk page. Also it could be useful to add text telling about the links, but it would require a bit more CSS and extra translation work. Samu698 (talk) 15:04, 4 July 2022 (UTC)

## Alt text

Has there been any consideration to add alt text to many parts of this wiki? It would be nice if several images either describe the item's name itself or didn't at all in certain other cases for accessibility reasons. -- PanchamBro (talk • contributions) 18:30, 4 July 2022 (UTC)

## Curious

Should HP redirect to Health or something else? -- PanchamBro (talk • contributions) 15:05, 7 July 2022 (UTC)

Since the page doesn't exist, it shouldn't direct to anything. ;) margotbean (talk) 15:20, 7 July 2022 (UTC)

## Wiki Bot

I don't think It will be added but I'm working on a feature for the Governor bot in the stardew disc, and it technically scra\*es (spam filter, replace with a "p") the wiki - if it gets added it probably won't be used too much but are you all ok with that? Just thought I'd get permission. AnotherPillow (talk) 12:02, 31 July 2022 (UTC)

Hello AnotherPillow! I've forwarded your question to Cole and the server people. I wouldn't expect an answer today (Sunday), but please check back! Thank you, margotbean (talk) 16:59, 31 July 2022 (UTC)

Thanks! The wiki doesn't have any sort of Rest API for getting info that's inside of tables does it? Just a lot simpler than scraping it AnotherPillow (talk) 13:03, 1 August 2022 (UTC)

No API that I know of. A bot sounds fine; I discussed it with Cole &amp; the server folks and we'll notify you if any problems arise, but we don't foresee any problems with it. Thanks! margotbean (talk) 17:19, 1 August 2022 (UTC)

On a related topic, are the admins/maintainers aware of and using Auto-Wiki Browser (AWB)? It's a wonderful tool for loads of different tasks. Pangaea (talk) 07:33, 7 September 2022 (UTC)

Yes, we're aware of it, thanks! margotbean (talk) 18:51, 7 September 2022 (UTC)

## Infobox switching

Hello, I am new to the wiki. I wanted to ask if there is a function to have different versions of pages/infoboxes. For reference, this is a thing on the OSRS wiki. A good example is Hat of the Eye (on OSRS . wiki) , where players can select between the different colors by using the tabs on top of the infobox.

I was thinking this would be useful for tools, to account for their upgraded forms in one article.

If it is not possible, is there anyone interested in implementing it? I wouldn't know how, but if someone could point me to some documentation I'd be willing to take a look and try to learn.

Thanks, Termades (talk) 18:00, 6 September 2022 (UTC)

Unfortunately, tabbed sections require an extension this wiki doesn't have installed. So, it's not possible at this time. margotbean (talk) 19:00, 6 September 2022 (UTC)

Who has control over our installed extensions? Would that be something that the wiki community thinks is worth installing? From working on OSRS wiki, I can vouch for its usefulness. Termades (talk) 02:40, 7 September 2022 (UTC)

I have actually brought it up with the other admin before, seeing it used on other wikis. But we decided that the changes to 12 languages wouldn't outweigh the benefits. If the wiki were new, the chance that we would decide to install the extension might be higher, but after 6 years and 12 languages, I don't see this as something we'll be installing. Perhaps it will be appropriate for the Haunted Chocolatier wiki, whenever that comes around. margotbean (talk) 17:47, 7 September 2022 (UTC)

Is it Tabber you speak of, or has there come something better in the last couple years? Also, while browsing the *Versions* special page I noticed that Scribunto is installed. Don't know how to use it myself, but from experience on other wikis, it was incredibly powerful. You (Termades) could perhaps try to play around with it and see what you come up with? Pangaea (talk) 10:13, 9 September 2022 (UTC)

## Domain Name and visibility

I am not sure on the "corporate structure" of the wiki, any funding sources, or our total budget. However, I would like to propose the following, with that in mind.

I think the wiki would benefit from moving to "stardewvalley .wiki" instead of the current "stardewvalleywiki .com" address. Ideally, we could also register "sv .wiki" as well for a short link. This would be more in line with other top fan wikis, and since it seems we arent using wiki .gg or Fandom, we should have control over our domain.

Again, obviously I am not in a position to know of any problems that might be in the way of such a move, but I would like to put it out there for discussion.

Thanks, Termades (talk) 02:48, 7 September 2022 (UTC)

ConcernedApe has sole control over the domain name. At this point, moving the URL would require redirects in 12 languages, so I don't see it as likely. You can contact him, but I wouldn't expect a response. margotbean (talk) 17:50, 7 September 2022 (UTC)
