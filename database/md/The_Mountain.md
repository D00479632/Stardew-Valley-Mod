From Stardew Valley Wiki

**The Mountain** is an exterior region in the northern part of Stardew Valley. Initially, there are only two exits: to the south leading to Pelican Town, and to the west leading to the Backwoods. However, over the course of the game, several events open up new routes:

- On Spring 5, debris blocking the bridge north of the lake is cleared, providing access to the Mines and the Adventurer's Guild.
- On Summer 3, an earthquake opens a pass north from the Mountain to the Railroad.
- The bridge leading to the Quarry at the east end of the map can be repaired (by completing all Crafts Room Bundles or purchasing "Bridge" from the Joja Community Development Form for data-sort-value="25000"&gt;25,000g).
- The Glittering Boulder blocking the water flow west of the mine entrance can be removed (by completing all Fish Tank Bundles or purchasing "Panning" from the Joja Community Development Form for data-sort-value="20000"&gt;20,000g).
- After completing the Community Center or purchasing the JojaMart subscription for data-sort-value="5000"&gt;5,000g you can purchase a "Community Upgrade" which will upgrade the trailer and open up some hidden passages. One will be located south of the Adventurer's Guild and will lead to the river waterfall north of JojaMart.

## Fishing

Fishing Zones in the Mountain Lake.

A large lake containing many types of fish fills the middle of the Mountain map. The Carp found here are particularly easy to catch, making the lake a good location to practice fishing early in the game. A Legendary Fish, the Legend, is also found here, as well as the Legend II, one of the five legendary fish II.
