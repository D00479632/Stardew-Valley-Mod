The **Garbage Hat** is a hat that can be obtained from checking garbage cans in town. It has a 0.2% chance to be found after opening at least 20 garbage cans.\[1] This can be increased by using the powers from the book The Alleyway Buffet.

Upon obtaining the hat, an explosion sound plays, and the lid of the garbage can goes flying off. The garbage can remains without its lid for a short time afterwards.
