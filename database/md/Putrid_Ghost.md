## Behavior

Putrid Ghosts will intermittently slowly fly through walls towards the player and charge them at increased speed, dealing damage on hit. They can cast a spell that inflicts a Nauseated debuff on the player, preventing them from healing with food or drink for 2 minutes. Eating Ginger or drinking Ginger Ale will cure the Nauseated debuff.

## Strategy

Stand still and swing at it with a sword or club right before it hits you. Ghosts are knocked back several tiles after being hit, so walking towards them may speed up the process of killing them. If you have the Desperado profession, a special attack from an Iridium Needle or Dragontooth Shiv forged with 3 Aquamarines has a good chance to defeat this enemy in one shot. Otherwise, use your best weapon with a Crusader enchantment, and wait until they slowly float back towards you for another strike. When they are charging you, run and make a sharp turn to avoid their green fireballs.
