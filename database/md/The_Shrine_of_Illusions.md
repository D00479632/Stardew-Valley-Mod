The Shrine of Illusions

**The Shrine of Illusions** is an altar found in the basement of the Wizard's Tower. The player can offer data-sort-value="500"&gt;500g to the shrine to change their appearance, name, favorite thing, and gender.

The Wizard's basement becomes accessible from a trapdoor in his house when the player has at least four hearts with him. It can also be accessed through a red portal in the Witch's Hut as soon as the Witch's Hut is accessible.

## Trivia

- Changing the character's name to include item spawn codes triggers an Easter egg.
- Changing the favorite thing to be "ConcernedApe" or anything containing "Stardew" gives special dialogue when collecting a stardrop.
