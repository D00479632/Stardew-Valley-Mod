Cave Flies are an enemy monster found in the Mines. 80 cave insects (any type) need to be killed for the Monster Eradication Goal at the Adventurer's Guild.
Grubs hatch into Cave Flies shortly after entering their cocoon phase, during which time they are invulnerable. Be sure to kill off a critically-hit Grub before it can enter its cocoon.
Behavior
They fly at you (including through walls) at high speeds, damaging you on contact. Then they loop around for another pass.
Strategy
Stand still and swing at them with a sword with high knockback right before it hits you.
A swarm event of Cave Flies (green mist) can easily overwhelm a low-level character, so it's advisable to carry enough stone to craft a staircase if you don't have an efficient weapon.
History
1.0: Introduced.
1.6: Changed Monster Eradication Goal for cave insects from 125 to 80.
