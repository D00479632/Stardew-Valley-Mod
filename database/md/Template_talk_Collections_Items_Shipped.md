Hi!

I'm new here and want to help update this template to 1.6. Particularly, I would like to update the image of the third page to contain new items, such as Mystic Syrup and Dried Fruit, together with their hyperlinks. Also, Pickles and Juice have new icons and Clam was removed. How can I do that?

I'm pretty sure I know, or am able to learn, how to handle the technical side. All I need to know is what procedure I should follow - I can't edit the page directly because it is protected. Am I supposed to provide the code and the resources here for someone authorized to add them?

Hello Adayah! The template is protected so that editors know that template changes need to be carried out in all 12 languages. If you're willing to do that, that would be amazing!

Once you have figured out the new structure of the underlying table, it will be the same in all languages; the only difference between languages will be the specific terms used in links. And, those can be found by unpacking the game files.

The first step would be confirming that the screens in all 12 languages looks the same. In past versions of the game, some items were in different places across languages, so we need to make sure that's not the case with v1.6. After that, we need new images for all languages (the sprites for Milk and Goat's Milk vary in Spanish, French, and Japanese, with Portuguese using the Spanish image). You can see all languages' variations here: Category:Collections images.

Once the correct images are uploaded, then work can begin on the template. The structure is basically this: The images are the background of a table, and each table cell is a link to an item. Familiarity with html tables would be helpful.

So, do you think you'd like to take on all 12 languages? margotbean (talk) 18:05, 6 April 2024 (UTC)

Hi. I'm also interested in helping editing this template. The missing item pages are already created, such as Smoked Fish and Mystic Syrup, this will be mostly a matter of reordering and adding the new items. Can we use these images already uploaded? I'm familiar with HTML and have edited templates in other wikis. Let me know if I can help.
