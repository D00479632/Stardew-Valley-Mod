The Legend is a fish that can be caught during Spring in the Mountain lake during rainy weather. It is one of the five Legendary Fish, so it can only be caught once per save file, or once per player in Multiplayer.
The special requirements necessary to hook a Legend are:[1]
Fishing level 10, either naturally or using Fishing Buffs.
The bobber must be located in water with a Fishing Zone of 5, i.e., it must be at least five tiles away from any land (including bridges) in every direction.
The Legend can appear one tile closer to land (Zone=3) if the bobber lands in bubbles.
The region of the lake near the large submerged log meets this requirement, as suggested in Secrets of the Legendary Fish. However, there are other locations in the lake that also work.
When all of these requirements are met, each cast has a 10% chance of hooking a Legend (20% if using a Curiosity Lure). Contrary to the information provided by The Fisherman, Act II, none of the other Legendary Fish need to be caught first.
Although the Legend cannot be hooked again after it is caught, it is still possible to obtain multiple Legends in singleplayer. The player can catch up to 3 by using Challenge Bait, or an infinite number by Panning in the correct tiles with the Fisher enchantment (so long as the player has not already caught the Legend normally).
The Legend can be caught regardless of weather or season using Magic Bait.
