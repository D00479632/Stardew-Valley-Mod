- **Quality** is an attribute of items including crops, fish, and artisan goods. (Trash, minerals, and resources do not have quality). Quality has three levels: silver, gold, and iridium. Higher qualities improve the sale price and the friendship increase from gift-giving.
  
  - Improving quality depends on skill and on various other methods related to the item involved:
    
    - Crops can be improved by using fertilizer and with farming skill;
    - Animals by care, happiness, and mood; Fruit Trees by annual aging;
    - Forageables can improve with skill, or be guaranteed iridium quality by the Botanist profession.
    - Fish quality can be improved by fishing further from land and having a perfect catch.
    - Certain artisan goods can be aged in a cask. Some animal goods provide higher quality output (see animal product variants), such as Large Eggs resulting in golden mayonnaise.
    - Cooked items can be made gold quality with Qi Seasoning.
  - Quality improves the sale price from 1.0x to 1.25, 1.5x, 2.0x.
  - In the game's code, each item is assigned a value from zero to four. 0 represents no quality; 1 silver, 2 gold, and with a gap, 4 represents iridium quality.
- **Shops** allow the player to purchase items for gold. Most shops are run by a villager and some are reachable by telephone to get an overview of their service. While all shops sell items, some shops also allow the player to sell items to them to instantly generate revenue. Shops are affected by the Days of the Week, including their trading hours and stock.
  
  - Some shops, particularly in the lategame, only sell items for barter. Namely, these are the Desert Trader and the Island Trader.
  - Items that cannot be sold to that shop will be greyed out in the inventory.
- Time: Time in Stardew Valley is divided into days, weeks and seasons. Each day consists of 20 hours, each week of 7 days, and each season of 28 days. As some examples of the days of the week, most villagers will have different routines, moving to different locations around the Valley. Store hours and stock may also be affected. It will also affect what programs are shown on television.
- **Bars** are units of metal material used for upgrading, crafting, and construction purposes. They are produced by *smelting* in a furnace using coal and ore. Like many other materials they can be purchased from shops, albeit indirectly, by buying the 5 ore and 1 coal from Clint. For example a Copper Bar costs 525g (Y1) when purchased in this way, and an Iron Bar costs 900g ((5+1)\*150g Y1). (It is not worth transmuting purchased bars).

Purchaseable bars Bar Name Per 5x Buying Coal Copper Y1 75 375g 525 Copper Y2+ 150 750g 1000 Iron ... Gold
