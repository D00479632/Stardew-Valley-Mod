### Crystalarium

Selected products from the Desert Trader that can be bought using only Crystalarium materials. DT also has other barter stock that isn't included in this list.

- note that this is not always efficient and indeed, the Ruby/Jade ones are probably the only "good" examples. (Diamond takes 5 days to grow, and replaces 900g of Saloon-bought coffee; unless speedrunning, cloth and cheese can likely be farmed off animals.)
