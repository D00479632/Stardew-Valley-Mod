**Lava Crabs (dangerous)** are an enemy found in the Mines after activating the Shrine of Challenge or during the Danger In The Deep quest. 60 rock crabs (any type) need to be killed for the Monster Eradication Goal at the Adventurer's Guild.

## Behavior

They disguise themselves as Gold Nodes, sometimes surprising the player. When immobile, they are invulnerable to attack, though they can be hit with a pickaxe to knock them back, making them mobile again.

## Strategy

Lava Crabs may be differentiated from nodes by striking them with a weapon. A Lava Crab will make a knocking sound and a zero damage indicator will pop up when hit with a weapon, while a node will not.

The Lava Crab can only be dealt damage if it is mobile, and not hiding beneath its shell. Strike an immobile Lava Crab with a pickaxe to make it mobile again.

Striking a Lava Crab with a pickaxe enough times will knock the shell off of its back, and will cause it to flee. Alternatively, setting off a bomb near a Lava Crab can remove its shell, and will cause it to flee as well.
