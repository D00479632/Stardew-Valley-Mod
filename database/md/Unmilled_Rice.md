**Unmilled Rice** is a vegetable crop that grows from Rice Shoots after 8 days (6 when irrigated). Unmilled Rice is harvested using a Scythe.

Players have the ability to craft Rice from Unmilled Rice by using a Mill. Once placed in the Mill, one Unmilled Rice will make one Rice. Rice will appear in the box on the right side of the Mill the following morning.

Rice Shoots planted in most farm tiles take 8 days to mature. Rice Shoots planted approximately within 3 tiles of a water source (such as a pond or a river) in any direction are considered to be irrigated. Paddies need not be continuous with each other or adjacent to water in order to count as irrigated. Irrigated Rice Shoots mature in 6 days.
