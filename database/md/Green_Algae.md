**Green Algae** is an item that can be caught using a Fishing Pole during all seasons at any freshwater location, with the exception of the Farm Pond on the Standard Farm. It is never caught in Crab Pots.

It is also dropped from Green Slimes (10% chance), and may be produced in Slimejack, Crayfish, Snail, or Periwinkle Fish Ponds. It can also be gifted by a pet cat with max friendship. It can also be found in Garbage Cans.

Green Algae is displayed in the Fish section of the collection tab, and counts towards the four fishing Achievements.\[1] However, it is otherwise not considered to be a fish, and therefore cannot be sold to Willy at the Fish Shop, does not benefit from fish price bonuses, cannot be used in place of "Any Fish" in recipes, and cannot be put in a Bait Maker, Fish Smoker, or Fish Pond.
