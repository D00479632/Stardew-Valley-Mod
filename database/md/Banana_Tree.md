The **Banana Tree** is a type of fruit tree. The sapling can be purchased at the Island Trader for 5 Dragon Teeth, found in a Golden Coconut when broken, or as a reward from Large Animal collection in Island Field Office. It takes 28 days to grow to maturity, after which it will produce one Banana each day during the Summer in Stardew Valley or year-round on Ginger Island. It can only grow in the center of a 3x3 square, each square of which must be kept completely clear of objects, flooring, and terrain features. The 3x3 grid must not overlap the 3x3 grid of another Fruit Tree.

For each full year after maturing, fruit trees will produce higher quality fruit, up to iridium star quality after three years. Note that the 3x3 square around the tree doesn't have to be kept clear once the tree has fully grown.

If struck by lightning during a storm, a fruit tree will produce Coal for 4 days instead of fruit.

Fruit trees can be planted in the Greenhouse.
