Produces One Mini-Obelisk per craft
A Mini-Obelisk is a crafted item that can be placed anywhere within the boundaries of the farm in Stardew Valley (not Ginger Island). Two of them are used as a pair to teleport the player from one to the other.
The crafting recipe is obtained after completing the Wizard's special order quest "A Curious Substance".
Limitations
Placing a third Mini-Obelisk on the farm will trigger the error message "You can only place two."
Placing a Mini-Obelisk outside the farm will trigger the error message "Can only be placed on the Farm." This includes the inside of buildings, e.g., the farmhouse and sheds.
Placing a single Mini-Obelisk on the farm is permitted, but no transportation is enabled without a second one.
The Mini-Obelisk cannot be used to transport the horse. The player cannot interact with the Mini-Obelisk while riding the horse.
The Mini-Obelisk will not function on Ginger Island.
History
1.5: Introduced.
1.6: Fixed issue where Mini-Obelisk would sometimes teleport the player onto a tile occupied by a farm building. Mini-Obelisk warp is now 0.75 seconds faster.
