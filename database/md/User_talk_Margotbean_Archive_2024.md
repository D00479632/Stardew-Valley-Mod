## Most Helpful Contribution (Especially From New Editors)

Hi, I’ve been checking out the recent changes page every so often for a while now in anticipation of the new release and it’s clear that you have a lot on your hands. The “Help Editing” page doesn’t give any pointers towards the kind of changes that would be most helpful to you and the wiki, so **(a)** I was wondering if you had any in mind (or if there’s a “wanted tasks” list that I missed!)

Two more related questions -

**(b)** if a user spots vandalism before you get to it, do you prefer that they leave it to you or revert the change?

**(c)** the “help editing” page says that changes in formatting should be applied across all languages. What exactly does that encompass? I assume new information can be added to only one language, but what about adding a new section to an article?

And finally, one question that is only partially related - **(d)** do you think it could be worth adding a note to Emily’s page explaining why Clint isn’t one of her friends, as this seems to be a common cause of confusion and incorrect edits? I’m sure this is on her talk page but it may be worth adding to the actual page for those users who only read the wiki. --Gravy (talk) 22:27, 2 January 2024 (UTC)

Hello Gravy! I haven't had a "help wanted" list since v1.3, so, no, there's nothing I can point you to. After v1.6 releases, it's going to be a free-for-all, so knock yourself out then (so to speak). :D

You should clean up vandalism if you see it. If a vandal has made several changes to a page, that involves hitting the "undo" link multiple times, starting with the most recent change, and working backwards. It's time-consuming and can be confusing looking through the version history list, but that's the best way to ensure information isn't changed or lost in the process. If I come along later and see something has changed, I may revert the cleanup and then revert the vandalism, because I have access to more powerful links to do so. You should *not* take it personally! I appreciate vandalism clean-up!

Changes to existing formatting require discussion, adding a new section (if it's substantial) should also be discussed. When version 1.6 is released, new information will be added without discussing formatting, as people discover it. New pages and sections will be added, and no one is expected to add them to all 12 languages. But until then, formatting changes encompass everything on the wiki.

As for Emily and Clint, they may well be friends after v1.6 is released. There is new dialogue being added, so we may (or may not) see more of their relationship being revealed. I don't know. The basis for "friendship" was always "if they give a gifting hint, they're friends, otherwise not." But I added a table for that and removed the field from the infobox on each villager's page, so their friendship is subjective and open to interpretation now. I don't think we need to take action until after v1.6 is released.

I'll update Help:Editing to reflect that some of the "rules" don't apply to version 1.6 as well. Happy Farming! margotbean (talk) 19:44, 3 January 2024 (UTC)

## Quarry Floors in The Dangerous Mines

In The Mines, dungeon floors are a type of floor that spawns in The Mines after The Player enters the Quarry Mine for the first time. The floors spawn Haunted Skulls, copper and iron slimes, copper and iron nodes. I added a blurb to the quarry section of the Mines Page, just so you know. Have I done something wrong when doing this? 9000 (talk) 5:57, 5 January 2024 (UTC)

I cleaned up the language a bit, but otherwise it's fine. Thanks for your contribution! margotbean (talk) 19:10, 5 January 2024 (UTC)

## The Main Page not updating its image

In the Main Page of this Wiki, it has an image to the right of the Stardew Valley logo, which changes depending on the month of the year, the main page image changes to "Banner Right Winter" in the following months: December, January, and February. This is an image of George's House in Winter. And in December of 2023, the main page image didn't get updated. Should we set up a code in the Wiki where it automatically updates the main page image, instead of you editing the page too many times? 9000 (talk) 4:51, 8 January 2024 (UTC)

Thanks for the reminder! margotbean (talk) 20:21, 8 January 2024 (UTC)

## Missing Link

It seems that a link to the Bus Stop page on the Main Page is missing, can we get a link to the Bus page on this page? Because it is considered a location in the Valley section in this Wikipedia page. 9000 (talk) 5:05, 13 January 2024 (UTC)

## Harvey 4-heart and 8-heart Events

Margot, on 31 Dec 23 you reversed an edit by 9000 that stated Harvey needed to be in the clinic in order to trigger the 8-heart event. Are you sure? I have documented (privately) that his presence is required for both 4-heart and 8-heart events. I think that game behavior disagrees with the event file. Perhaps there's a bug? Giles (talk) 18:49, 15 January 2024 (UTC)

The game files are pretty clear: Harvey needs to be at the Clinic for the 4-heart event but not the 8-heart event. margotbean (talk) 20:11, 15 January 2024 (UTC)

## You commenting to edits in all caps

Hello Margot, in the 9000 talk page, you made a discussion about us commenting in all caps, and you told us to stop doing it, you do this when you edit sometimes, when you're shouting at Users to stop doing something, like adding too many links, adding gibberish, etc. You did not answer my topic for the Bus Stop link in the Main Page, or Battery Packs in the Bug Lair, why don't you answer somebody's topic sometimes? Please explain Margot. 9000 (talk) 05:53, 21 January 2024 (UTC)

## Periods after Reference Links

Hello Margot, in many pages in the Wiki, they have References, but for some reason, if there is a Reference Link at the end of a paragraph, you put the period right after it instead of before it. Please reconsider doing this. 9000 (talk) 06:11, 21 January 2024 (UTC)

## Steam Achievements Work When SMAPI is Launched as a Non-Steam Game

On the "Modding:Installing SMAPI on Windows" page, it says it is currently untested as to whether Steam achievements work when SMAPI is launched as a non-steam game. I tested it out and got a video of it working! I can't post an external link here, but if you're interested then let me know how I can send it to you. Milkants (talk) 00:46, 31 January 2024 (UTC)

I'm confused as to why you posted this here, Milkants... Please go ahead and edit the modding page, and place a comment on its talk page saying the video is on youtube, and the video id is D5ooOUCDnAY. ok? Thank you, margotbean (talk) 03:28, 31 January 2024 (UTC)

## Latest revisions of the Milk Pail and Shears pages

Hello Margot, in the Milk Pail and Shears pages, the latest revision for these pages are both 16 February 2020, at 15:21. No Users have changed these pages for almost 4 years now, just so you know about it. 9000 (talk) 05:51, 4 February 2024 (UTC)

For reference, below is a collapsible table about the two items:

Tools used on the Animals 

Image Name Description Price Milk Pail Gather milk from your animals. data-sort-value="1000"&gt;1,000g Shears Use this to collect wool from sheep data-sort-value="1000"&gt;1,000g

## Uploading Files to v1.6

Hello Margot, since v1.6 is right around the corner, there's gonna be a lot of files that need to be uploaded, including 12 different languages. Who's gonna do all of the files? Is it gonna be margotbean (talk) or Pathoschild (talk) (This is an example because they're both translators)? Also noticed that the Spoiler tag has updated, it now uses Rotten Plants instead of Jinxed, instead of warning just Mobile Players, it is now warning all Players, just so I point this out because it is gonna be a big day for the Wiki for the release of v1.6. 9000 (talk) 08:57, 7 February 2024 (UTC)

## Fertilizer

I'm glad I found an acceptable edit for my recent findings about Deluxe Retaining Soil. Since then, I've continued some investigations and think I may have more to distribute across various articles on the subject, but I'm not likely to find a way to make those edits that wouldn't be disruptive in the context of the v1.6 release, so I will be holding off. I also need to formulate just what it is I ought to say, so I have no material to look at right away. And I hear that v1.6 may be close? So, just a heads up that something's pending with me, and it might affect structures within somewhat (not sure). I do find there's not much said about fallow but tillable soil, and that whole subject does have implications for fertilizer, so I've got to look around and find where that belongs. All the best for v1.6! Giles (talk) 20:43, 13 February 2024 (UTC)

Thanks for the heads up! You may find that I'm so frazzled, I don't care what you change... (Don't tell anyone, though!)

I don't know how close v1.6 is, there are a fair few bugs to be fixed, but when it's released you might find some things have changed with regard to fertilizer. The alpha change notes (Modding:Migrate to Stardew Valley 1.6#Vanilla release notes) already contain a change to tilled soil underneath seasonal Wild Seeds on Ginger Island, so if you're going to deal with those type of seeds, there may be even more changes with v1.6. You may find a bug specific to v1.6 as well, although I hope not.

Anyway, thanks again for the heads up. Please proceed with your project, and have fun! margotbean (talk) 23:00, 14 February 2024 (UTC)

And thanks for the v1.6 heads up, too. I think now that the best approach won't end up changing article structures much: perhaps a new section, once, mostly paragraphs and/or sentences. So that doesn't look too serious. "V1.6 close" is what I've been hearing since November, so I think I won't wait. Who knows when it will be, really? A Wild Seeds change sounds like a special case wrt the stuff I've been digging up - a detail, not a basic behavior. Should be a small change once it comes. Giles (talk) 00:25, 16 February 2024 (UTC)

## Reversing revisions with links

Hello Margot, in my Contributions for 9000, there are a bunch of revisions of lowercasing links, we previously changed lowercase to capitals, but you didn't like that and got cross, we then started lowercasing every link there exists, but you are reversing our edits without giving a reason. Can you please stop doing it? Are you reversing yourself now, do you think that lower is caps now, or do you just not like changing links? Please reply and thank you. 9000 (talk) 08:14, 16 February 2024 (UTC)

Your edits are not productive, they do not improve the wiki, but they do make more work for me at a *very* busy time. It's clear that you're not a native speaker, and you make many mistakes that I have to clean up. If you have no new information to add, or an obvious typo to fix, please stop making edits. I understand that you may feel the urge to contribute, but you are simply not helping to make the wiki better. Thank you. margotbean (talk) 21:41, 16 February 2024 (UTC)

Hello Margot, I promise I'll stop doing edits like this, but the reason that this was done is because English only uses capitals for the start of a sentence or proper nouns, such as Villager names in Stardew Valley. If you use too many capitals in a sentence, it may lose the flow of writing in English, due to how many capitals there is. 9000 (talk) 05:41, 18 February 2024 (UTC)

## Enforcing Rules that don't exist

Something strange has caught my attention in my two days of being on the Stardew Valley wiki. Every single edit of mine has been deleted or reversed. Strange?... I look at the revision history of all the changes I have made, and something strange sticks out to me. All of the changes done by you? What a coincidence! So my intuition tells me that "maybe I'm breaking some sort of rule?". So I go onto the "help page" but when I scroll down to read it I don't see a single rule stating that what I did was wrong?

Here are some of the rules I have "broken"..

- as both a Console and PC player, I noticed that some features available on PC are not available to be accessed on Console (e.g., Some Profile Easter eggs like clicking on Haley's picture) . So, to be helpful, I added a little bit of info, so console players don't get stuck trying to do something that they can't do. And no, it's not a bug. You physically cannot click on the pictures for a reason. It would be frustrating if, instead of scrolling through two options (scroll left, scroll right), there was a middle option that didn't do anything useful other than waste your time.
- the glitches page: You had a discussion? No, you didn't. I can see past logs. You know that, right? You came to an agreement with yourself that that page shouldn't exist. Adding onto that, your original gripe with the first version of the page was that it was dedicated to a single glitch. My new page was devoted to a plethora of glitches not jus the single one you had a problem with.
- Guys can get pregnant. Yeah, you heard that? Not every person who sets their farmer to male has a pair of testicles. If I were a trans guy, I think I would like to know if my farmer is getting pregnant or my spouse or if I had an option.
- I literally uses the exact same format as the other info on the heart event page.

Honestly I feel like It would make everybody's life's easier if we had an actual formatting rules page instead a single page that doesn't really say mutch. BortVonFinklestein (talk) 21:43, 17 February 2024 (UTC)

If you read the sections on Editing and Formatting, you may notice that large-scale changes need to be discussed first. As for the rest, you will find that getting upset will get you nowhere.

If players using a controller cannot access the villagers' moving portraits, that's a bug that needs to be reported on the forums. It's most definitely not intentional.

If you wish to take up the issue of gender with ConcernedApe, you wouldn't be the first. I suggest you use the forums or email him. margotbean (talk) 22:21, 17 February 2024 (UTC)

## Golden eggs from fishing treasure chests at low fishing levels

Hello Margot, in the fishing page, the golden egg is one of the possible rewards from fishing treasure, with this item, it can be processed in mayonnaise machines to produce 3 gold quality mayonnaise, or it can be put in the incubator to hatch the golden chicken. This item requires perfection to be able to appear in treasure chests. Leveling up all of the skills to the max is required to reach perfection, though the page says that you need fishing level 2 or more to snag this item, it can only be caught when the player reaches perfection. This is very interesting in the page, please reply. Thank you. 9000 (talk) 09:45, 21 February 2024 (UTC)

I've removed the fishing level required, since it's superceded by perfection. margotbean (talk) 17:00, 21 February 2024 (UTC)

## Emily at 2 Hearts

In Emily's 2 Heart cutscene, which is triggered by entering Emily's House, the Wiki used to be incorrect. It used to say *Enter Emily's house.* This cutscene cannot be triggered when Emily is not at her house. The user Clashccc (talk) corrected the page, you need to enter the game's code to see if it is actually true. The page *User:Margotbean/HeartEventTriggers* used and still says it right now, it says *Emily's House*. This needs to be corrected. Thanks. 9000 (talk) 05:55, 2 March 2024 (UTC)

Please release yourself from worry about pages in my personal user space. And please be aware that this is an incredibly busy time, since v1.6 is going to release on March 21. Please make your edits and your requests with that in mind. margotbean (talk) 06:13, 2 March 2024 (UTC)

## 1.6 Release Date

Hi, I have two quick questions - 1) concernedape's twitter seems to say v1.6 will be released on the 19th, but in your above reply you said 21st. Did I miss something somewhere? (just wanted to make sure both for myself and in case you accidentally had the wrong date down!) 2) is it worth adding the release date to the main page? I know this is something you would have to do and it's only two weeks away, so it may not be, but not everyone has an X/twitter account and seeing the announcement tweet is difficult without it for some reason (I had to follow a link from an article to see it). Gravy (talk) 01:22, 3 March 2024 (UTC)

Difficult, yes. I have tried the same and was unsuccessful. And I refuse to create social media accounts for myself since they are too much overhead in my life. I'd appreciate this kind of info on the website whenever possible. Giles (talk) 05:18, 3 March 2024 (UTC)

The release date is indeed March 19, the first day of Spring, not the 21st. https://twitter.com/ConcernedApe/status/1762192764899627457 margotbean (talk) 16:44, 3 March 2024 (UTC)

:) Margot, the first day of Spring is March 21st. Perhaps that's why you were thinking about the 21st. Giles (talk) 23:04, 3 March 2024 (UTC)

Eureka!! That's it!! Thank you Giles!! margotbean (talk) 17:16, 4 March 2024 (UTC)

Hi, do you all know when 1.6 is out for console? Last time I checked it said "As soon as Possible" but that was a little while ago. THX! ItsMe101 (talk) 12:28, 18 April 2024 (UTC)

## Stone Golems

Hello Margot, in the Monster Eradication Goals, the category for Cave Insects includes bugs, dangeous bugs, cave flies, dangerous cave flies, grubs, dangerous grubs, mutant flies, mutant grubs, and stone golems. But what this is talking about is the stone golem, prior to v1.5, the monster used to be named Zombies, and had their own category, but this is very odd, if you killed this monster, it wouldn't apply to the Cave Insects category, but to the Zombies category. The Zombies category was removed and applied to Cave Insects to v1.5. 9000 (talk) 05:58, 8 March 2024 (UTC)

There never was a category called "Zombies", and killing Stone Golems never counted towards any monster eradication goals. margotbean (talk) 14:43, 8 March 2024 (UTC)

## Meteorites in multiplayer

The Meteorite that spawns on the farm is a random event that has a 1% chance of being chosen when the player sleeps overnight. The meteorite appears in a random location within the farm and destroys any crops or crafted flooring within that area. If you mine a meteorite, it drops 6 iridium ore, 6 stone, and 2 geodes, but if you play in multiplayer, the amount of items dropped counts towards how many people are playing, such as playing with *4 players* drops 24 iridium ore, 24 stone, and 8 geodes, which also allows four iridium bars to be smelted in a furnace, instead of just one iridium bar as an extra note. 9000 (talk • contributions) 08:24, 16 March 2024 (UTC)

## Crafting Ingredients

Thanks for your message. I didn't realize 1.6 was coming out so soon or I probably would have waited. And I also didn't realize big changes have to be approved first. Yes, I found the cooking ingredients so helpful on that page that I copied that format. One reason I think my format is better than a short list as in your example is I find it very helpful to have the items divided by category and with their seasons specified. Then I know that in Spring I need to get certain crops, for example, or these are all the things I need to get from the mines. And there's a precedent for that format, and also for having it on the same page, on the cooking page as you mentioned. If I were going to put those ingredients on a separate page, then I think the cooking ingredients should also be moved to a separate page for consistency. Shouldn't those two pages be consistent? I know that my longer format is a tremendous amount of work (and it was) which is probably why it hadn't been done before, but other than it almost being out-of-date, since someone's done it, could the update stand once I've edited it for 1.6? Thanks for your appreciation, btw. I made a similar update on the RSV wiki for a lot of information that was missing on the quests page and my changes were reverted without any message or explanation. Never played RSV again, lol. Susb8383 (talk) 21:16, 17 March 2024 (UTC)

Yes, yes, and yes. Oh, and I'm sorry about the RSV wiki!

Yes, your longer format is fine if you feel it's helpful, and yes, we can build the tables once v1.6 is released. I would strongly prefer a link to the page, so that the page would be "Crafting/Ingredients" (a sub-page of Crafting) and then a simple link to it under a heading "Ingredients".

And yes, the Cooking page should be the same! Unfortunately, there is only one of me, and 12 languages to try desperately to keep cohesive. With all the 1.6 changes (and all the daily changes across all 12 languages), moving ingredients to a separate page has been pushed to the bottom of the "to do" list. One of us could easily do it in English, but then what about the other languages? It's a relatively simple change, someone just has to find the correct translation for "see \[this page]" and then move the section. It sounds straight-forward, but around language #6 you start to think "Wowsers, this is a lot of work, did I make a mistake in German, oh geez, I have to check that" and then you lose your place... Well, it gets complicated very fast. Having said that, if you want to attempt that change in all 12 languages, that would be stupendous. (!!)

Otherwise, we'll concentrate on Crafting for now, start creating the tables in 2 days, and then migrating the changes to the other languages will be part of v1.6 changes, more likely for translators to pick up and do themselves.

Long story short, thank you, thank you, and thank you! margotbean (talk) 21:45, 17 March 2024 (UTC)

## Updating page to reference .NET 6 instead of .NET 5 after latest SMAPI update 4.1.1

Hi. I would like to add information about the change with recent update to the SMAPI. Right now it requires .NET 6 not as previously .NET 5, but I'm not allowed. Specifculy I'm talking about this Wiki Page Editing Modding:Modder Guide/Get Started  
\--unsigned post by FlameHorizon (talk) 07:07, 20 March 2024‎

I've pushed the edit through. Please remember to sign your posts with 4 tildes `~~~~`! margotbean (talk) 16:31, 20 March 2024 (UTC)

## where to cover details for secret or hidden boxes?

i noticed that you deleted a page i just created because of the name, which is understandable as it's not a great name. i just picked that name because these boxes have similar interaction like the first package upon starting a new save for the first time. should i just cover the details of these boxes in the respective locations' pages for now, or do i hold on to them for now until a page is decided for it?

(few of the boxes' locations have already been mentioned in some pages like in Tent Kit and Books pages.) - Sooji gooji (talk) 19:39, 20 March 2024 (UTC)

Hold, please. margotbean (talk) 19:43, 20 March 2024 (UTC)

## Mossy Tree

Hi, following the removal of references to Mossy Tree, I've planted a Mossy Seed in my farm and the following tree grew out of it (see pic), is this not a mossy tree?

Hello anonymous! If you're not sure, why are you editing the wiki? margotbean (talk) 19:55, 22 March 2024 (UTC)

Sorry, forgot my tildes! I tried to upload an image to show you the new tree. YuvixAdun (talk) 19:56, 22 March 2024 (UTC)

S'all right. My last response may have sounded snippy, but it's a serious question. If you're not sure, then why make changes to the wiki? If you are sure, then there's no discussion. See what I mean? margotbean (talk) 20:03, 22 March 2024 (UTC)

Okay, lesson learned! I am curious what that new tree is, but lets find out! :) YuvixAdun (talk) 20:14, 22 March 2024 (UTC)

Okay, I'll take that to heart also. It's sort of me who raised the question, but I did it by entering misinformation into the articles. My instincts are pretty good, but not infallible. I can also get in too deep by intending to do wordsmithing, and drifting into fuzzy details. Sorry for any confusions. Giles (talk) 21:26, 22 March 2024 (UTC)

Hey guys, no need to apologize -- please read the response to the question below! margotbean (talk) 16:44, 23 March 2024 (UTC)

## Mossy Seed - Tree Variations

Hello, sorry in advance for the confusion but I have planted my mossy seed and saw it grow into a large all-green mossy tree, and went through the game's .xnb files and found the images for it. The tree was simply named tree 3 Green Rain, and when tapped it produced fiddlehead fern. I added this information to a Mossy Tree page, and another user alerted me that their mossy seed had grown into a different tree, which when they looked into the .xnb files for, they found under tree 1 Green rain. Their tree cannot be tapped like mine, but it spreads seeds around it (whereas I'm not sure mine does). Now we have these two confirmed (but separate) trees that grow from the same seed, with a possible third variant (the file tree 2 Green rain) coming from the mossy seed as well. It seems that these are called the Fiddlehead Stalk (tree 3 Green rain) and the Wild Tree (tree 1 Green rain), but I'm not sure how to validate the legitimacy of these names...? Right now the Fiddlehead Stalk is named under the Mossy Tree page, and I was wondering if there was a way to update it to a new name once one is confirmed, and also on how to proceed with formatting when 1 seed can produce many variants of a tree. Should it be three separate tree pages, or one page with all of them? Thank you so much for any guidance.

Hello anonymous editor! The fact is, there is no in-game name for these trees, and I don't know what to call them to differentiate them from other trees that have moss on them. If we stick to the game files, then they are "Green Rain Trees". They all start with the green rain event.

I think we should discuss the proper name for them, and try (try!) to decide quickly, before the name gets copied into 11 other languages and becomes an indelible part of history. If we have already decided on "Mossy Tree" then we need to be explicit about the difference between a "Mossy Tree" and a tree with Moss on it. Because "Mossy Trees" come with and without moss on them. 🥴 margotbean (talk) 16:44, 23 March 2024 (UTC)

Just chipping into this discussion, I agree that calling is Mossy Tree is a bit confusing with the other trees which can also have Moss on them. I think this name comes from the fact that these trees can be grown using Mossy Seed, which is a bit of a misnomer since its not necessarily moss related. Perhaps 'Green Rain Trees' is the best we can do.YuvixAdun (talk) 17:23, 23 March 2024 (UTC)

Adding my bit since I've been helping do some research and editing for the Mossy Seed and Mossy Tree Wiki pages. From what I've seen, The trees have been labelled as the Fiddlehead Stalk and the Wild Trees(as there are two of these variations) by the community. The other editor and I were in the process of asking an admin(not sure who) how to handle formatting of a seed that produces 3 variations of tree, but the Mossy Tree wiki page seems to be no more.Tmh 3:08 PM, 23 March 2024 (CST)

i was gonna suggest to name the new tree just "wild tree" as it's mentioned in both the mossy seed and mushroom log's descriptions (that log seems to work the best with these trees), but i'm not sure now since those other seed trees could also be considered "wild" 😅 Sooji gooji (talk) 21:30, 23 March 2024 (UTC)

Hey, there's been a discussion here about various "Green Rain Tree" things, but I'll repeat my latest post there. "I'm just now realizing that the term "Mossy Tree" was removed and replaced with Green Rain Trees, but I personally believe that it should be reverted. I feel like that is what it should logically be called, and "Green Rain Trees" seems sort of weird, considering that they come from other sources besides that event. We can just put one of those notes at the top of the pages that says "Not to be confused with trees covered in moss."" Additionally, some of the specific variations are considered "Wild Trees" so that wouldn't work either. Brandon Echols (talk) 00:29, 27 March 2024 (UTC)

Ok, quick update. I sent out a small poll in the discord, and I have some naming preference results. "Mossy Trees" (with the notice at the top of the page) is unanimously preferred. I feel that, because of this, the title should be reverted. Brandon Echols (talk) 00:46, 27 March 2024 (UTC)

I'll probably just go ahead and proceed with these preferred names, as we can always change them/move the pages in the future. I feel that it is more beneficial to have the information published sooner with a minimal error, than for it to not exist at all. Brandon Echols (talk) 00:51, 27 March 2024 (UTC)

Ok, quite a bit has happened. I feel that it should stay as "Green Rain Trees" so forget everything I said above. This is mainly because "Wild Trees" is a new concept that consists of all trees in the wild. Because of this, **Wild Tree** would need to be moved to a page called **Bushy Mossy Tree** and **Lush Wild Tree** needs to be moved to Leafy Mossy Tree. These Bushy and Leafy adjectives actually come from the game code so it’s official. This also means that the Mossy Tree page can be changed to a “disambiguation page” (a list of what it may mean) of sorts. I can handle this, as long as you take the protection off that page, though. :) And don't worry-I'll make sure to add plenty of "Not to be confused with..." notices. I know this is a confusing topic, but I believe that this is the least confusing method. Margotbean, because you have the permission to move pages, I would appreciate if you could do this. :) Brandon Echols (talk) 02:25, 27 March 2024 (UTC)

Related discussion and information: Talk:Green\_Rain\_Trees YuvixAdun (talk) 08:05, 27 March 2024 (UTC)

Yep, so the new names aren't official yet; **They should not be changed; not yet.** Brandon Echols (talk) 17:22, 27 March 2024 (UTC)

Believe it or not, I'm just fine with taking no action at all for now. Well, on this subject anyway. 😁 I really have a lot of other work to do (on the wikis)! Cheers, margotbean (talk) 17:26, 27 March 2024 (UTC)

## Adding Gifting section on new items

Hi, im new to the wiki, ive been experimenting and writing down the likes and dislikes of the new items for the villagers. I recently added the Gifting section to Dried Mushrooms.

If what im doing is acceptable for the Dried Mushroom ill move onto the other items with gifting once I finish Dried Mushrooms. Thanks. Im also not sure how to add the date and my name (TheyCallMePie is my editor name) Ill try adding the "TheyCallMePie (talk) 02:53, 26 March 2024 (UTC)" at the end to see if that works, im not familiar with formatting on here yet.

## 1.6 Fish Code changes

As you may know, 1.6 changed the coding for special fish spawns (e.g. Legendary fish, Night Market fish, fishing presents, etc.). Pre-1.6, their spawns were taken care of in functions called getFish in the game code. However, for most of them, their spawns are now taken care of in Data\\Locations.xnb. Upon inspection, very few (if any) of their percentage chances of catching have actually changed. Therefore, I will change all of the necessary getFish references to reference Data\\Locations.xnb instead. Letting you know because these changes won't need history sections as nothing related to the actual gameplay changes. Thanks. User314159 (talk) 20:57, 26 March 2024 (UTC)

That's quite a task to take on, thank you very much, I appreciate it! margotbean (talk) 21:30, 26 March 2024 (UTC)

## Trying new template

Hi Margotbean, I want to try and add a new template to make it easier to include a reference to a specific mastery, like

```
{{Mastery|Farming}}
```

which would then generate an icon and a link to the mastery page. I'm not familiar with creating templates (yet!), but can I just add and try to get it to work or is there some playground I can test in? Obviously I'll add it in all 12 languages :) YuvixAdun (talk) 05:51, 27 March 2024 (UTC)

I appreciate your enthusiasm, but now is not the best time to be creating a new template, especially one requiring unofficial translations (like "Mastery Cave"). Margotbean

## Inventory, Tabs, Player Menu

I'm confused about the use of terminology and the organization of the Wiki regarding matters intersecting these items. "Inventory" has long meant the first tab of (the Player Menu?, or what?), and its page seems to indicate that it's just the first tab. But I'm not sure we're consistent about using "inventory" in that way. We have separate articles for other tabs, some of those new, but where do we describe what a "Tab" really is and where to find it? Inventory? We seem to have no article that draws all the tabs together (no "Player Menu"), to describe such a central UI feature. And isn't "Player Menu" often used as inventory? I think it's all a bit jumbled, and the website lacks sufficient topical articles to help sort out distinctions and separations from unions and conjunctions. Now is as good a time as any to put any changes into practice.

One more element to this: Mastery. The Mastery Tab displays just the Powers of the masteries, not all the effects of them. The Mastery Cave article certainly could be used to put all mastery features together, but that would probably mean listing the powers there as well, introducing replication, yet the tab needs the info also.

So I'm asking for guidance on how the Wiki should be structured, for all of us. But I'm also asking for terminology intent, that the texts may be clear. It's certainly a bundle!

There's also a little matter of how the player is supposed to be able to track progress towards the next mastery level in-game, when the Mastery Tab doesn't seem to give that information. I've got that on Talk:Mastery Cave too, but if you know... Thanks for your patience! Giles (talk) 02:08, 29 March 2024 (UTC)

I can address some of that! The player menu refers to the entire set of tabs that pops up in-game when you hit "E" or "Esc" by default. The player tab is the 2nd tab from the left on that menu, right after the inventory tab. It does introduce difficulty, since both terms use "player". But the two are different! Some places refer to it as the "Skills Tab" as well, which isn't awful, but outdated.

When I get the chance to breathe, I can make more wiki changes. margotbean (talk) 16:43, 29 March 2024 (UTC)

Thanks! The more I look at it, the more I'm inclined towards the idea of a Player Menu article. I could write up a good intro right now, starting with the clarifications you just gave me. It would need an image - of the default display when it pops up. But that's essentially the "Inventory Screen" section of Inventory right now, which needs updating anyway. Splitting off that part of Inventory would lead to two short articles, true, but it would also make distinct the shift between global and local foci of topics and emphasize where all the many tab articles are centered. Just a thought. Giles (talk) 18:24, 29 March 2024 (UTC)

Second thought, in place of the original above. Perhaps Player Menu could be a name redirect in the article space - to Inventory. Inventory is the way it pops up, and separate sections could be devoted to the two purposes, with the need for only one image to oversee all, and wording to avoid duplications.

## Name change + code reference question

Hi, just made this account to make some edits but realized too late I didn't add an "x" to the end of my username to make it "Gofer2x". It's my usual username and I'd prefer to keep it consistent across sites. I've looked online and Mediawiki seems to let admins change usernames, could you change it for me if not a problem?

Also, I want to dig through the code and add some references to some wiki pages. But if the relevant code is in a bigger function (like several hundred lines long), do I only point to the function or add extra details (e.g. `Foo.Bar::Baz`, `case 35`? I imagine a line number could also work but it could differ across setups.

I'm sorry, I'm unable to change usernames.

When giving code references, how specific you want to get is up to you. I wouldn't add line numbers or case numbers, because decompilers can change those. But adding something simple like "the use case for 'nameOfCase'" would be fine.

Please remember to sign your posts with 4 tildes! Thanks! margotbean (talk) 16:30, 29 March 2024 (UTC)

Hello from my new account, then. And yeah, that's a good point (haven't even considered case numbers potentially being problematic). I'll do my best, I suppose. Thanks! Gofer2x (talk) 23:51, 29 March 2024 (UTC)

## Legendary Fish in Fish Ponds

Hello Margotbean, we was just looking under the different legendary fish, and we noticed that they can be put in fish ponds now, as we just noticed roe and aged roe in the different pages. Note that this does not include the Legendary Fish II. 9000 (talk • contributions) 21:30, 29 March 2024 (UTC)

You can get the roe now because of the Jewels of the Sea book, which allows you to get roe from Fishing Treasure Chests. They still cannot be put in Fish Ponds. User314159 (talk) 22:48, 30 March 2024 (UTC)

## Trout Derby edits

An Error 503 occurred while I was trying to edit the Trout Derby page, so I copied the page with my new edits so it wouldn't get lost. After the errors subsided ~10 minutes later I pasted the new text and submitted but the old text didn't get fully deleted for whatever reason which resulted in duplicating content. I fixed that immediately afterwards. Just letting you know in case you were wondering about those edits. User314159 (talk) 22:48, 30 March 2024 (UTC)

## Parrot Egg missing info

Hello Margotbean, I noticed that Parrot egg page was missing some crucial information (lack of which made me personally stressed out until i found out), so I added it in. I am unsure whether my writing style is up to the standards, but I beg you not to remove that information. The game does not reforge the trinket if your total earnings are under 750,000. But it still takes the materials. It feels like it is a bug, as nowhere it is mentioned that you must have earned a specific amount of gold before being able to have a higher level companion. I believe its for everyone's benefit to keep that information. I have messaged you on discord for better communication, as I am open to discussions or changes that I have to make in order to keep that information on the page. Silentjunimo (talk) 21:24, 31 March 2024 (UTC)

## Adding 1.6 items to Template:Collections\_Items\_Shipped

Hello Margotbean, I noticed that the Collections page, and the template it uses, Template:Collections\_Items\_Shipped, was not updated yet. Specifically, the Items Shipped, Fish, and Cooking sections. I went to go update the image File:Shipping\_Page\_1.png, but the image didn't change after uploading for some reason. Thankfully it didn't change, since I realized a couple of minutes later that Template:Collections\_Items\_Shipped was protected. I did try to undo it, but it wouldn't let me (I guess only admins can do that?). So, I was wondering if you could undo that edit? And, if possible, maybe allowing edits on Template:Collections\_Items\_Shipped so that it can be updated? ItsDaCreeper (talk) 22:44, 31 March 2024 (UTC)

Hello @Margotbean, I am using the Nintendo Switch version of Stardew and I have noticed that the template does not match the shipping tab on the console version, specifically the clam is missing from the bottom of page 1 between the juice and the poppy. I don't know if this is something that has come from previous versions, or if the clam is removed in the latest update (which we console players do not have as yet). Could you advise?

## Redirects

I've been adding some redirects to the wiki and you've been deleting them. Personally, I think the redirects provide a tremendous amount of value. However, since you've been deleting them, presumably you think they are just clutter and/or not necessary. Would you allow me to possibly convince you otherwise? As a basic example, take the case of "book seller". If I type that into the wiki, it currently looks like this, giving 0 results and giving the appearance that such a thing does not exist on the wiki at all. However, of course that is a lie, because the page "Bookseller" exists. This is confusing because in normal English, "book seller" is always separated as two words. The only reason that it is different on the wiki is because ConcernedApe made a typo / grammatical error when implementing it into the game, and the wiki explicitly follows the in-game conventions.

You could imagine a scenario with a user being something along the lines of: "Oh, the Book Seller is in town today. I remember from last time that they sell rare books, but I don't remember anymore which specific ones that are sold. No problem, let me look that up on the wiki! \[types in "book seller", gets no results]. What the heck? I guess the wiki doesn't have any information on the book seller yet, so let me just do a Google search for "stardew book seller" and see what I can find. \[does Google search] Wait a second, the Google search just pointed me back to the wiki. Oh, I see the problem now, bookseller is one word on the wiki. That's really annoying!"

We can fix up this user story with a redirect. By making "book seller" redirect to "bookseller", we can plant users exactly where they expect to be with 0 friction. Perhaps we could call these type of redirects "search redirects", which have the explicit goal of saving the user time or preventing a second click and/or a second google search. Unfortunately, I know that such "search redirects" will show up in the MediaWiki admin tools as "orphaned pages" that don't link anywhere else, which will make them show up alongside other legitimate pages that do need to be deleted. However, I think that search redirects provide so much value that they should be excepted. Please consider this request. --Zamiel (talk) 10:14, 3 April 2024 (UTC)

Hi, to your specific mention of "Bookseller" - the word *does* exist in English; it is a noun that is defined as the proprietor of a bookstore or one who sells books. (https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/bookseller) ConcernedApe did NOT make a typo or grammatical error.

So, while redirects might be useful in some circumstances, for this one, it is moot. Rogue.toast (talk) 21:01, 3 April 2024 (UTC)

My inquiry is not just about bookseller. It is about "search redirects" more generally. Search redirects provide value regardless of whether or not the word exists in a dictionary. I could come up with some equally compelling example that does not exist in the dictionary. e.g. Joja Mart --&gt; JojaMart --Zamiel (talk) 23:48, 3 April 2024 (UTC)

## Version History edit revert

I would like to ask why my edit on the Version History page was reverted. I feel like I wasn't doing anything wrong, my edit was constructive (I added a ton of links that readers can immediately visit in order to read more info on things mentioned in the changelog), and I even removed an inaccurate edit (eg. Meowmere is not mentioned anywhere on the official changelog because it is secret, but it is listed on the wiki's changelog). Anzasquiddles (talk) 18:30, 3 April 2024 (UTC)

Removing info, even if you feel it's a secret, is cause for reverting it. You also linked to a lot of redirects instead of main links. I don't have time to pick through each sentence with the influx of edits, and trying to prepare updated content offline, so the entire edit got reverted. margotbean (talk) 19:08, 3 April 2024 (UTC)

## Scythe

Hey there, on my last edit I just removed the section that stated, "If it is lost (by dying in the Mines, for example), a new one should spawn the next morning, either next to the bed or in the refrigerator." which I mentioned in my edit history. In the 1.6 update ConcernedApe fixed this issue, so that none of the scythes can no longer be lost.

Ps. I understand that you don't want 1 page for all the scythes, but I thought it might be better to just update the pages individually. For example the Iridium Scythe page does not state that with it "upgrade" (obtaining it) its chance of chance of adding a piece of hay to the silo, when cutting grass goes from 75% to 100%. (when compared gold scythe to iridium) I was just gonna focus on changes like that. To make sure all the information is updated and relevant. Emily Romano (talk) 20:00, 3 April 2024 (UTC)

## GiftHeader displays outdated info

hi boss  
as of 1.6, several villagers have new dialogue when given gifts on their birthday (Jas, Vincent, Penny, Shane, Lewis...). the GiftHeader tag does not account for this and still shows the old generic dialogue. i assumed the most elegant solution was to simply remove the GiftHeader tag and manually write in the info it displays, including the new dialogue, but I've been shouted at for attempting this. will GiftHeader be updated to account for the new dialogue?

Hello DrDean (remember to sign posts with 4 tiles, plz!), sorry for the shouty caps. The answer to your question really depends on whether or not someone wants to update the template in all 12 languages. Today is the first day I'm able to access the wiki without errors since v1.6 released, so I can tentatively start to make template changes, but there are several (**several**) changes to be made. So, do you know what a switch/case is? Do you have any interest in changing the template in all 12 languages? margotbean (talk) 20:06, 11 April 2024 (UTC)

it's alright, i understand the frustration. this is my point though - it seems like more hassle than it's worth to update the template to account for every edge case. unfortunately i'm monolingual and have a very loose understanding of wiki formatting so i won't be much help with it. perhaps the part of GiftHeader that contains birthday dialogue could be removed, and each villager's page could have their respective birthday dialogue written in manually? so it would look like ==Gifts==, then {{GiftHeader}}, then 'For loved or liked gifts, Jas will say...' etc. i would happily do this for the English wiki but unfortunately i won't be much help for any of the translations. DrDeanDingleman (talk) 02:48, 12 April 2024 (UTC)

It might be better that way, but that would still require changes to the template (in all 12 languages). margotbean (talk) 18:37, 12 April 2024 (UTC)

i could do that then, with your permission? i suppose i don't need to understand the language to remove info. this would leave the non-English wikis without any birthday dialogue for a while until a proper translator wrote it in, but if you're okay with that i can go ahead and change the template(s). DrDeanDingleman (talk) 02:33, 20 April 2024 (UTC)

NO. The translations are in data files and must be added to the template. I appreciate your desire to help, but this is not a "starter template", it's advanced. margotbean (talk) 17:54, 20 April 2024 (UTC)

Would it be helpful in the meantime to collect the custom birthday dialog for each language? I don't know how to access data files, but anyone can copy it down by switching the language in-game, as long as they know enough about the language to write it accurately using a keyboard (if it doesn't use a latin alphabet). That way when someone is able to make the changes to the template, they will already have most of the missing data. Scarecrow (talk) 18:55, 20 April 2024 (UTC)

Copy/pasting from data files is the way to go in all languages; the data is already written down there. If you want to write down Chinese characters as an educational exercise, I think it would be enlightening. But helpful to the wiki, not so much. ;) margotbean (talk) 20:40, 20 April 2024 (UTC)

## Trying to add silver quality to crab items in Grange Fair

Hi, I'm trying to add the silver quality to crab pot items without adding any other quality on the Stardew\_Valley\_Fair#categories section, but the row ends up being blank in preview. I've tried turning this: *Grangeptsrow|Crab|Crab|100|-4|qualities=0* into this: *Grangeptsrow|Crab|Crab|100|-4|qualities=0,1* , but it doesn't work. I noticed that you are the one who created the grangeptsrow template, so maybe you know why it isn't working.--Rayram (talk) 08:31, 16 April 2024 (UTC)

I met the same problem while dealing with silver quality items in the Fair. Maybe we could update the template. 群星之尘 (talk) 10:32, 20 May 2024 (UTC)

## Flooring Images and Icons

Hey, thought I should let you know that you missed the majority of new Flooring options added in 1.6. 32 regular, numbered flooring options were added in 1.6 (in "walls\_and\_floors.xnb"), in addition to the 9 "MoreFloors:X" floors. I'd address the issue myself, but I'm not sure exactly how you were extracting item icons from the game, given I was unable to find anything other the actual floor textures. These 32 numbered floors are all available from the regular catalogue, between (FL)55 (the pink love hearts one, old highest index floor) and MoreFloors:0 (the new dark wood planks). This also messes up the indexing for floor images, which might require admin powers to fix. Sicarious (talk) 13:43, 18 April 2024 (UTC)

## Misplaced commas in English

Margotbean, please stop ending your posts with commas instead of periods, this makes it look like the sentence continues but also ends. Thank you. 9000 (talk • contributions) 05:40, 20 April 2024 (UTC)

## The Timeline Image Change: Emily

Here is the difference between the 1.5 and 1.6 image: https://imgur.com/aA0Vcws

Also look at the main Emily image details it has been updated to 1.6, it even states so in the summary.

Here is another link to the original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/StardewValley/comments/1bjoly4/with\_update\_16\_emily\_now\_looks\_slightly\_less/ Emily Romano (talk) 20:49, 20 April 2024 (UTC)

The timeline images were uploaded by ConcernedApe. There is no official update to them for v1.6. margotbean (talk) 18:31, 21 April 2024 (UTC)

I was not aware of that, in that case since the change is not as noticeable as the previous ones, so ConcernedApe probably didn't want to add it in. Sorry about that, I thought the timelines were made by users. Emily Romano (talk) 18:48, 21 April 2024 (UTC)

## Desert Festival Calico Eggs Template

Hey there again, I was wondering if you could make a template like the Carpenter's Shop, Casino, etc for the Desert Festival. Since there are so many items that now require Calico Eggs to be purchased. Plus, it would make the infobox look a lot neater and be easier if any future items needed to be added. Emily Romano (talk) 18:53, 21 April 2024 (UTC)

## Shipping Collections

There's a few items not on the shipping collection page and I'm working really hard to reach perfection but I can't figure out what 5 of the items are. One looks likes a first and the others look like containers of some kind? I'd attach an image but I don't know how to. ImStruggling (talk) 01:27, 22 April 2024 (UTC)

## Temporary Lock on Farmhouse page?

Hi! Would it be possible to temporarily lock the Farmhouse page (like the Alex page)? Editors (I'm assuming non-PC) keep on changing the price/hardwood of the second Farmhouse upgrade back to the 1.5 amounts. Thank you! Bluestblur (talk) 16:35, 24 April 2024 (UTC)

Done, thank you! margotbean (talk) 19:50, 24 April 2024 (UTC)

## Cushion Pages

I was going to make pages for the new cushions that don't have pages yet (yellow, green, red, etc. from the regular furniture catalogue) but I saw the textbox saying that the page I was trying to create had recently been deleted, then linked me here to see discussion about it. I didn't see any discussion, so I'm sorry if I'm missing something! I didn't create any of the pages yet, but I was curious what was wrong with them, because I thought we had all the information to create them. A small issue in the grand scheme of things, but the red links on the furniture page and in the furniture navbox look out of place! RaeOSunshine24 (talk) 14:10, 25 April 2024 (UTC)

I fixed this issue, the cushions now have pages. We were waiting for information on how to get them. The information needed was received recently, so I made all the cushion pages. Emily Romano (talk) 17:33, 25 April 2024 (UTC)

## Cask Productivity Templates

Hi there, I would like to fix the Cask productivity page but I need some new templates to do so, for example: Template:CaskProductivity-top. If you could make those so that I can remove the stub, that would be amazing. Emily Romano (talk) 18:06, 25 April 2024 (UTC)

## Pig active days (Just deleting content)

Instead of just deleting content, it's traditional on wikis to poke a poster if something was unclear. Especially for users who have user accounts. (This is referring to Pig article.) I linked to my source, but I can explain it more as I put it back in. --Emky (talk) 13:07, 30 April 2024 (UTC)

Anyway, the explanation, as I described: I summed up all the days of the year, omitted winter days, accounted for the guaranteed-sunny days, the guaranteed rainy days, and per the data on Modding:Weather data (which is in the game code, explaining how the daily weather works), applied the probabilities (as stated on the reference page) for each day across the year (summer having its own separate probabilities) to come up with the 69 number. I searched after and discovered I was not the first one to do this.

Specific section of reference: Modding:Weather data#Rainy and stormy just under it, which is just a prettification of the generation higher in the page. --Emky (talk) 13:11, 30 April 2024 (UTC)

Hello Emky, please read Help:Editing first! After that, please put the calculations on the Pig talk page and refer to them there. Thanks, margotbean (talk) 19:38, 30 April 2024 (UTC)

## Carpenter's Shop

Hi, Margot. I'm unable to edit the Carpenter's Shop page. Is it locked? Vandalism? Giles (talk) 21:30, 30 April 2024 (UTC)

Hello Giles! People keep changing the requirements for upgrades to the pre-1.6 requirements, not reading the history section. margotbean (talk) 21:42, 30 April 2024 (UTC)

Oh. Any idea how long the lock will continue? Giles (talk) 23:04, 30 April 2024 (UTC)

Block expires in 1 month. margotbean (talk) 16:18, 1 May 2024 (UTC)

## wicked statue image

Why exactly did you revert my edit of the wicked statue image? The crafting recipe for it gives the variant without red eyes, so I feel that that's the better "default" image for it. Though, when I uploaded it, it seems that cloudflare had cached the old version, so the new image didn't show up properly (see the comment i left in the page source of Wicked Statue). ~trillian (talk) 16:48, 1 May 2024 (UTC)

Perhaps a better question might be "Why *exactly* did you upload images without reading the section on images in Help:Editing?"

To answer your question *exactly*: I had no idea what you were doing, replacing an image from 2017 that's used on multiple pages (including templates) in 12 languages. Perhaps a better choice would be to upload a new image without glowing eyes and name it appropriately, for use in the infobox on 12 pages total. margotbean (talk) 16:58, 1 May 2024 (UTC)

Because every single use of that image, in both templates and pages, refers to the statue item, which does not have glowing eyes in the Crafting menu, or when it's in the player's inventory, or 99% of the time when it's placed in the world. Which is why I changed the old image and uploaded the previous version under a different name. I fail to see how anything in the images section of Help:Editing is related to this, though I guess I could have added more edit summaries. ~trillian (talk) 17:05, 1 May 2024 (UTC)

## Page for deletion

Hi, I just noticed that **Farming mastery** still exists. The discussion that happened over a month ago appeared to have had the consensus of just having the information on the Mastery Cave page, so I think it's a candidate for deletion. User314159 (talk) 17:12, 1 May 2024 (UTC)

## Adding links to Modding:Community

Hi, I want to add myself to this page as requested by SDV Discord moderators. Unfortunately I'm developing an external tool on GitHub Pages, and therefore linking to it was automatically flagged as harmful. Can you kindly assist? Brokencygnus (talk) 18:57, 4 May 2024 (UTC)

Done! (Added your entry to the page) margotbean (talk) 20:07, 4 May 2024 (UTC)

## Passing out at 2am penalties

Hi, I recently made an edit on the Day Cycle page to reflect that Marlon finding you at 2am doesn't lose any money. You removed the edit saying that you do indeed lose money to Marlon, but I tested it out several times and got the same result every time. I have proof in screenshots which I uploaded to Imgur, but I currently cannot add external links without admin permission. I want to show you the screenshots, and if you agree with my results, please let me redo the edit. Eggfan859 (talk) Eggfan859 (talk) 07:01, 8 May 2024 (UTC)

No way! Please forgive my incredulity, but this was a bug I reported with the 1.5 beta, and never got a response. Now I wonder which version fixed it? Hmmm...

Well, I will restore your edit, but it would be nice if *someone* could test and figure out if this is a 1.6 change or if it was fixed in v1.5 and I never noticed! Thanks for your message! margotbean (talk) 18:40, 8 May 2024 (UTC)

Thanks for responding! I just tried to test this out on 1.5.6, but every time I passed out, I was found by someone other than Marlon. I was using an old save file that was still in version 1.5.6, and played around 13 days. I'm not sure why I couldn't get Marlon. Maybe I wasn't progressed far enough in the game? (the old save file is in Fall Year 1, but the adventurer's guild is open so I thought it would work). I would be happy to do more testing if I could get my hands on a 1.5.6 save file that is progressed further to eliminate that possibility. It could be the case that Marlon only finds you if you pass out in Skull Cavern. Thank you for your time :) Eggfan859 (talk) 22:42, 8 May 2024 (UTC)

Argh! I appreciate the effort! margotbean (talk) 21:47, 9 May 2024 (UTC)

I did a lot more testing on 1.5.6 hotfix #3. I was able to use the save file someone provided me. I found that Marlon can only find you when you pass out in Skull Cavern or on the farm (outdoors). And you don't lose any money to him. Eggfan859 (talk) 21:15, 11 May 2024 (UTC)

Oh, that's so funny, I apparently stopped checking my gold in-game after reporting the bug! Well, I definitely appreciate you doing the research!! Thank you!! margotbean (talk) 21:31, 11 May 2024 (UTC)

## Prismatic Butterfly

Hi, I added a file for a gif of the Prismatic Butterfly yesterday but had not edited it to an actual page yet. I had been wanting to add it to the Statue Of Blessings but was unsure of where to put it or with what formatting to use for it so I had opted to just not make the edit and leave the file page there in case a larger contributer wanted to add it themself. I noticed that it had been deleted due to not having actually been used though. Endle (talk) 10:51, 10 May 2024 (UTC)

## Dialogues for after green rain

I think there are dialogues for the day after green rain, as well as the green rain dialogues. I've seen Abigail saying "And just like that, everything's back to normal. It's like magic!", which a dialogue I didn't see in her page. Do you know which file do these dialogues would be in? I can add all villagers' dialogues. Thank you! Peaw (talk) 18:26, 12 May 2024 (UTC)

Hello Peaw! I used my text editor to search the entire "Contents" folder, and discovered that green rain dialogues can be found in the individual villagers' files, *e.g.,* `Characters/Dialogue/Abigail.json`, `Characters/Dialogue/Pierre.json`, etc. Good luck! margotbean (talk) 18:34, 12 May 2024 (UTC)

## Trying to add to one of the talk pages got "blocked"

I tried to post some information i aggregated to the https://stardewvalleywiki.com/mediawiki/index.php?title=Talk:Luck page but when i hit submit i was shown a cloudflare message saying i was blocked and that i should contact the site owner regarding the issue. I can still view the page but the info i tried to post didn't get added.

Hello anonymous commentor! There could be 2 things going on:

1. There is an unusual amount of traffic on the wiki today, so try again later...
2. You hit a heuristic error caused by html/C# code already on the page

Try again later (or tomorrow) and if you continue to have problems, I will archive the existing page so we can start fresh, without hitting the html/C# code already on the page. margotbean (talk) 22:08, 12 May 2024 (UTC)

Back again, (sorry I didn't include my username in the initial post)

So I tried again to post the information however this time i got a red box when i tried to post saying "Error: This action has been automatically identified as harmful, and therefore disallowed. If you believe your action was constructive, please inform an administrator of what you were trying to do. A brief description of the abuse rule which your action matched is: Adding external links"

The reason i've got the info in an external link is because there's a lot of information and i don't want to flood the talk section with a single post. The link in question is just a google drive link to a .txt file with my findings

--Aidanamite (talk) 21:05, 13 May 2024 (UTC)

Hello again Aidanamite! I looked at your text file, and the luck skill is unimplemented, but has been in the game code since before release. A lot of unused code was removed with v1.6, but not all of it. I don't think the wiki needs to document the unused code per se, especially since we have implemented code that isn't fully explored or documented, but I appreciate your comment! margotbean (talk) 21:41, 13 May 2024 (UTC)

The luck skill isn't unused. Being able to level it up with xp is, but items like rings and food that increase the luck skill still operate by the rules outlined in my document.

Also, i made this document based on the 1.6 code, i haven't looked at the code of prior version so all this information is up to date

--Aidanamite (talk) 22:15, 13 May 2024 (UTC)

## Why were changes reverted?

Hi, I wonder if you could tell me why my changes I made to the Cherry page are gone?

I added a reference to needing dried cherries for the raccoon request. This is helpful if you're trying to decided whether you need a cherry tree or not. I didn't get one because I had already shipped a cherry from my fruit cave and knew it wasn't needed in any recipes. Then I got the raccoon's request for dried cherries which means I needed five and had to buy a sapling and wait.

That's info that someone looking up cherries would want to know.

Can you tell me why my changes didn't stick?

Thanks. Susb8383 (talk) 22:49, 18 May 2024 (UTC)

Any fruit can be chosen for that request, it is random (see Giant Stump). So, in lieu of placing that request on *all* possible pages, we have the complete list on the Giant Stump page. It does no good to be told you *might* need a cherry if you never roll that request. margotbean (talk) 00:35, 19 May 2024 (UTC)

## Missing Willy Cutscene

Hello, I just encountered this cutscene with Willy where he talks about his "old friend" in the back of the door behind him in my new save, but I can't seem to find something about this in Willy's page, especially in heart events section. Is this on purpose, or should I add it myself? (I also don't know what the requirements are to get this cutscene, so if you tell me that as well I'll be so happy) Thank you! Peaw (talk) 12:08, 19 May 2024 (UTC)

Hello Peaw, that info can be found here: Fish Shop#Willy's Boat (warning: spoilers!) margotbean (talk) 18:29, 19 May 2024 (UTC)

## Thanks + Evelyn Gifts

Hey! First off, thank you for your kind message on my talk page, I really appreciate it! Your method of using a program to check the gift tastes was a lot smarter than me just manually checking each line in the gift tastes file, lol.

I do have a question regarding Evelyn's gift tastes/quotes, though. I'm running 1.6.8 - she likes Broken Glasses (and has unique dialogue for them), and she likes all beach forage that's not Seaweed (again, with unique dialogue). Item 170 (Broken Glasses) and category forage\_item\_beach are listed in liked items in `NPCGiftTastes.xnb`, and their quotes are in Evelyn's dialogue file. Did these things get changed in 1.6.9? I wanted to make sure before adding them back to the page. Thank you! Bluestblur (talk) 00:15, 13 June 2024 (UTC)

There was a bugfix for Willy's response to Triple Shot Espresso and to my surprise, *all* gift taste irregularites were fixed. The entire system got a good cleaning...

However, the current beta entry for Evelyn from `NPCGiftTastes.xnb` is:

`"Evelyn": "*gasp*... This is absolutely marvelous!$u#$e#You've made an old lady very happy./72 220 239 284 591 595 Raisins/`

`Oh my, it looks wonderful! That's very kind of you./-6 18 402 418 170 forage_item_beach/`

`Um, Where will I put this?/16 80/`

`...it smells awful./225 226 227 228 219 396 248 296 -4 330/`

`How nice. Thank you, dear.//"`

The relevant entries in `Characters/Dialogue/Evelyn.xnb` are:

`"AcceptGift_(O)170": "Thank you, dear. I've been looking everywhere for my reading glasses...#$b#My, my! They've become filthy..."`

and

`"AcceptGift_Positive_forage_item_beach": "Thank you, dear. This brings back such sweet memories..."`

If I'm reading this correctly, it appears that your original text on Evelyn's page was correct, and exactly as ConcernedApe intended. I will roll back my changes and the change that started this mess!

My thanks were sincere! You've earned them! margotbean (talk) 01:42, 13 June 2024 (UTC)

Ah, I see that he changed the dialogue to only be for *positive* responses. Thanks for the info! Bluestblur (talk) 16:05, 13 June 2024 (UTC)

## J Sign

Hello Margotbean. The furniture named "J" is written as "J Sign" in the wiki. I can understand this change because it's just a one letter name. Do you think this change would be necessary in other language wikis too? Thank you. Peaw (talk) 23:36, 15 June 2024 (UTC)

We cannot have one-letter page names; all languages will have to be changed. I think changing all languages to "J (sign)" would be appropriate. I will also have to change the image name. \*sigh*

Thank you for pointing this out! margotbean (talk) 13:39, 16 June 2024 (UTC)

Why can't we have one letter pages though? I'm fine with changing the page as "J (furniture)" or "J (sign)", but its name is "J" in game, so I think it would be better to put exactly like that. Peaw (talk) 14:34, 16 June 2024 (UTC)

It's a wiki thing. The body of the page can refer to it as "J" and not "J (sign)", but the page title should definitely be more than one letter. margotbean (talk) 15:48, 16 June 2024 (UTC)

## Holy Blade Spawn

Hello Margotbean! I have never edited a page like this before so I really hope I am doing it correctly! But I discovered some information about the Holy Blade and figured y'all would want to know! I just got two holy blades during a mine run and both of them spawned from defeating special (star antennae) black slimes! Unfortunately, I did not get the floor numbers but one floor was an all green monster room and the other was a normal round room. Both were in the lava, purple earth sections, roughly floors 85-95. Obviously, I don't know if this was pure coincidence or if it is an actual spawn requirement, but I figured it couldn't hurt to share since the wiki page for the Holy Blade is fairly limited. I hope this is helpful to you! Taypedispenser (talk) 19:22, 16 June 2024 (UTC)

Hello! It's wonderful that you got not one but *two* Holy Blades in one run! Yahoo!

I do believe that information is already on the Holy Blade page, though. The source says "The Mines" and we have The Mines#Special Items describing special monsters and drops. It is a rare event! margotbean (talk) 16:27, 17 June 2024 (UTC)

## Slightly incorrect furniture names

Hey! On the topic of furniture items with *slightly* off page names, I went through `Content\Strings\Furniture.xnb` and found a few more:

- J Painting should be J. Painting
- J Light should be J. Light
- Witch Broom should be Witch's Broom
- 'Wizard Tower' should be 'Wizard's Tower'

These are all pretty minor, but I just wanted to give you a heads up if you do want to change/move those pages. I think (hope) that's it for the furniture names. Bluestblur (talk) 21:12, 16 June 2024 (UTC)

Ack! Yes, I want to correct them, thank you!!!! margotbean (talk) 16:27, 17 June 2024 (UTC)

## New Version in Main Page

Hello Margotbean! I noticed that computer version is still 1.6 in the main page, but it's 1.6.8 now (and 1.6.9 soon). Should that be changed? Thank you! Peaw (talk) 10:31, 19 June 2024 (UTC)

Yes, its on my "to do" list. I suppose if I change it to 1.6.8, then v1.6.9 will release right away. :D Thanks for the message! margotbean (talk) 13:14, 19 June 2024 (UTC)

## Problem with a TR Image

Hello Margotbean! I was uploading File:AnglerLocations TR.png and somehow I uploaded the wrong file, twice... And now it doesn't let me upload a new version of it eventhough it's not the same file. Maybe I thought deleting the file would work? - Peaw (talk) 16:31, 20 June 2024 (UTC)

It is uploading the new version of the image, it just won't show the new version for a while (up to 5 hours). Have patience! I know it's annoying, but we can't seem to solve the problem permanently. Sorry, Peaw! margotbean (talk) 16:38, 20 June 2024 (UTC)

Ah yes, I see it now. Thank you! - Peaw (talk) 22:43, 20 June 2024 (UTC)

## Regarding Version History

Hello Margotbean! It's me again, with version history. In 1.5 notes, there is a monster named "spiker" listed but this never made it to game, should this be commented out? Thank you. - Peaw (talk) 09:55, 22 June 2024 (UTC)

Sure, I don't know when or where a spiker ever shows up in-game, so go ahead and delete it. Thank you!! margotbean (talk) 15:54, 22 June 2024 (UTC)

I believe "Spikers" are the sliding saws that damage you in the Volcano Dungeon. You can see their sprites in `Content/Characters/Monsters/Spiker.png`, and they're spawned by `VolcanoDungeon::GenerateEntities`. Since they're considered enemies, the frog spawned from the Frog Egg can eat them (in theory, this shouldn't happen because I think Spikers shouldn't be called by `Utility::findClosestMonsterWithinRange`, but I have no idea what's going on there). Bluestblur (talk) 16:17, 22 June 2024 (UTC)

## Outdated Template for Life Elixir and Energy Tonic

Hello Margotbean! We notice that Life Elixir cannot restores energy anymore in 1.6.4, and the tooltip now shows it restores "100%" health instead of 90 health and 200 energy. Meanwhile, energy tonic no longer restores health when consumed, with a tooltip of 500 energy.

There should be a minor modification on Template:Infobox or Template:EdibilityGrid for them. I don't know exactly how it works in game, but according to the wiki code for inedible items at the same part, it could be an effective way to define another specific value in "switch" function. Here is the code from Template:Infobox:

```
{{#switch:{{lc:{{{edibility|}}}}}
		| -300|inedible|ungenießbar|incomible|non comestible|immangiabile|食べられません|먹을 수 없음|ehetetlen|não comestível|несъедобный|yenmez|不可食用=
			<td id="infoboxsection">Energy</td>
			<td id="infoboxdetail">''Inedible''</td>
```

By the way, I think there could be wiki page for the item "Energy Tonic". 群星之尘 (talk) 15:53, 23 June 2024 (UTC)

Life Elixir uses Template:Infobox cooking, which already has parameters to handle the new values. Thanks for your comment! margotbean (talk) 17:39, 23 June 2024 (UTC)

## Cabin Locations Image Upload

Hello Margotbean! I think I messed up something about images, again. I uploaded **File:1.6 4p meadow close.png** and **File:1.6 4p meadow separate.png**, but now I see that according to other 4 player cabin location images, that "4p" shouldn't be there in the image name. I thought I can move it but I forgot that I can't do it in English wiki, lol. Can you move them please, and sorry about this. I want to put them in all language wikis -that has that page-. Thank you.Peaw (talk) 14:16, 25 June 2024 (UTC)

Sure, I can move the files, but what should the new name be? The other images end in "8p" because they show 8 cabins for 8 players. Don't your images show 4 players? Please advise! Thanks, margotbean (talk) 15:53, 25 June 2024 (UTC)

Other images for 4 players are named with this format: `File:<version>_<farmtype>_close.png` or `File:<version>_<farmtype>_far.png`. The "8p" text only takes part in 8 player images, and 4 player images don't have a "4p" text. `separate` is for 8 players, and 4 players images use `far`. So I'd suggest just removing the "4p" part (and change "seperate" in second image) from these images and rename them as `1.6 meadow close.png` and `1.6 meadow far.png`. Thank you! Peaw (talk) 16:09, 25 June 2024 (UTC)

Ok, you can find them at File:1.6 meadow close.png and File:1.6 meadow far.png, thanks for your patience! margotbean (talk) 16:14, 25 June 2024 (UTC)

## Stacked Joja Crates/Boxes

Hey! I just saw your revision of TITANOBOA's edit on Stacked Joja Crates, but the in-game name *is* actually "Stacked Joja Boxes". My bad, I think I missed this one when I did the furniture pass-through before. Bluestblur (talk) 18:11, 30 June 2024 (UTC)

i checked the data files, and didn't see it. Thanks once again for looking out!! XOXOXO margotbean (talk) 23:58, 30 June 2024 (UTC)

No problem! It's just a bit weird, since the item ID in `Data/Furniture.xnb` is "StackedJojaCrates", but the name in `Strings/Furniture.xnb` is `"StackedJojaBoxes": "Stacked Joja Boxes"`. Bluestblur (talk) 02:10, 1 July 2024 (UTC)

Maybe someday I will get used to searching for strings without spaces in the name... I dunno. But `"StackedJojaCrates": "StackedJojaBoxes/decor/1 2/1 1/1/999/-1/[LocalizedText Strings\\Furniture:StackedJojaBoxes]/67/TileSheets\\joja_furniture/true/collection_joja"` is just cruel! Anyway, thanks again for seeing that clearly and communicating with me! margotbean (talk) 18:46, 1 July 2024 (UTC)

## Cask Productivity

Hi there Margotbean, I really want to fix the Cask Productivity page to match the Keg Productivity and Preserves Jar Productivity pages, and remove the stub but I need a new template: Template:CaskProductivity-top. I am willing to put in all the information but I can't update the page without a new template. Emily Romano (talk) 20:46, 18 July 2024 (UTC)

Hi Emily, unfortunately I haven't had the time to clean up the furniture page following your last round of edits, so I'm going to have to say no to this project idea from you right now. But, I appreciate your desire to improve the wiki. Thanks, margotbean (talk) 20:53, 18 July 2024 (UTC)

Hi there Margotbean, I think that the furniture page looks absolutely amazing but I am sincerely sorry if you don't like it. I really thought I helped. I will refrain from editing any future pages if that is what you would like? Just let me know. I never meant to cause any new issues, just help. Emily Romano (talk) 20:56, 18 July 2024 (UTC)

Hi Emily, I know you had the best of intentions, and your work was a big help! It really was! But I do feel like the formatting needs to be fixed on the furniture page. The wiki community pitched in and fixed some of the issues, but there is still some amount of cleanup that needs to be done.

As far as today's edits, you made changes to a template without discussion, created redlinks on a page, and *then* started a discussion about it. So, it all comes down to a basic lack of experience, **and** perhaps you never read Help:Editing. So, my decision remains "no" for the Cask Productivity edits. I think that playing on mobile is also a bit of a disadvantage for you, since you don't have the 1.6 update. I'm not going to forbid you from making edits, I have no reason to do so. But please read Help:Editing before considering larger projects, and please start a discussion before making them. Thank you for the improvements you made to the wiki! margotbean (talk) 08:46, 20 July 2024 (UTC)

## Deletion of Useful Personal Page

Hi there, apparently it is against terms to have personal pages? I think this page that was deleted (User:Zamiel/Gold\_to\_Energy\_Ratios) was very prolific within the min/max speedrun community. Can this just be restored as an actual page? I had only just found it and it was extremely useful as I was learning to min/max the game and there are many links to it via speedrun websites and forums. Please reconsider the removal. Uber2a (talk) 02:16, 19 July 2024 (UTC)

I'm sorry Uber, but Zamiel had advanced notice of the deletion, and seems not to have made an effort to move the data elsewhere. Traffic on the wiki makes editing impossible at times, and even affects read access, making it slower than it should be. Guides that aren't used or even referred to on the wiki, but are linked to from "many other sites" are one of the culprits. There is a section on the official forums for guides and resources, and I suggested it be moved there. But, again, Zamiel had plenty of time to copy/paste the data to a google spreadsheet, github program, etc. and failed to do so. (The pages also hadn't been updated in over a year.) So, they were deleted.

I was able to find an archive of the main page from the old wiki: https://web.archive.org/web/20220103173825/https://stardewcommunitywiki.com/User:Zamiel/Gold\_to\_Energy\_Ratios

This info could have easily been exported or copied to a google spreadsheet, so Zamiel is the one you need to chastise. No, go and create a github repo or a simple spreadsheet and distribute the link to that! —margotbean (talk) 08:46, 20 July 2024 (UTC)

## can ban this guy?

Hello Margotbean,sorry to bother you.Can ban the user:Siki from Chinese wiki?He\`s a totally online translator user and cant even write Chinese correctly!All his work is making a mess!Now this guy is editing Version History!WTF!Ban his id and ip,please!I\`m begging you!骑凤散人 (talk) 16:28, 20 July 2024 (UTC)

Oh dear! I will leave a note on Siki's talk page instructing him to read "Help:Editing" and not to use online translators. I see that he asked you a question on your talk page, is there a reason you don't want to communicate directly with him? margotbean (talk) 18:11, 20 July 2024 (UTC)

You are so kind,but Leaving a note won\`t help,trust me.The reason why he left message on my talk page was that I cancelled wrong Chinese sentences which he translated.Well,maybe we shouldn\`t call them sentences.I know he really want to make a contribution to wiki,but the truth is,not everyone suits.He\`s not help.Please do something to save Chinese wiki.骑凤散人 (talk) 19:30, 20 July 2024 (UTC)

Sorry,margotbean.I made a mess of the page, although I did my best to manually translate the page. Inevitably, I still use an online translator. I'm trying to recover, please give me some time.对不起，骑凤散人。您也许曲解我的意思，我只是想向您请教下关于书名号的使用问题，因为我刚加入到Wiki不久。谢谢理解。Siki (talk) 15:49, 21 July 2024 (UTC)

## Please update

Hello,margotbean!Please update ConcernedApe page from the Japanese wiki. It is now outdated. Thank you for your work on the wiki.Euaks (talk) 06:16, 25 July 2024 (UTC)

Hello Euaks! I don't speak Japanese, so I can't translate it. If you mean that I should copy/paste from the English wiki, I could do that, but it would mean deleting a lot of translated data. margotbean (talk) 07:46, 25 July 2024 (UTC)

## about Universal Loves

Hello Margotbean!Given that we got 6 Universal loved gifts,how about adding them into Loved Gifts part of Villagers infobox or just putting a Universal loved gifts Link there?Ofcouz,Haley and Penny are exceptions.I know these infos already existed in the text and table,but it will be more clearly and easier to read and find.Please think about it!(btw,you can find an example on Chinese wiki,Krobus change by someone)骑凤散人 (talk) 08:38, 29 July 2024 (UTC)

## Chests outside farm

Hi, I play on switch/PlayStation both of which are still on versions where chests can be destroyed by villagers outside farm but I can't see the map anymore even on old revisions- this is incredibly frustrating, can the section be kept for old versions? It's not even possible for me to update these platforms yet. Cooscoos (talk) 12:00, 29 July 2024 (UTC)

## Green Rain Tree picture

Hello! I hope you've been doing well during this period!

Since the image of the Stage 1 of the Green Rain Trees in the game doesn't match the one on the wiki, I tried to upload a new image (I'm not sure about the mechanism behind the visual changes of the Mossy Seed, but I planted all the Mossy seeds I had in fall in the game, and none of them looked like the one on the wiki, which seems to be a recolored Acorn). After uploading the file, I found that updating the previous file used in wiki seemed like a better option, but I don't want to make any further edits before determining the mechanism, so I am requesting your opinion. What do you think should be done? 第二个熺 (talk) 17:44, 31 July 2024 (UTC)

Hello 第二个熺! Thank you for your question! I think it would be best to upload the new image as a new version of the old image, then mark the new image with `{{Delete}}`. Without looking into the game code, I suspect the current/old image is a seed that is spread by an existing tree, and not one that can be planted by the player. But who knows? It is clear that the new image is more suitable for the wiki.

Remember that images sometimes take hours to update, so after uploading the new image, it may not show up right away. You must be patient. Thanks again! margotbean (talk) 20:04, 31 July 2024 (UTC)

## Dinosaur Egg Secret

Hey Hi Hello Margotbean!I saw you adding the sentence"After hatching the first Dinosaur Egg, Demetrius will gift the player a Triple Shot Espresso."into the entry" Dinosaur Egg" before.Here\`s the question:Could you tell me the info source or the correct way?I'm not doubting you,but I've been trying all night with no success(no mail,no gift when talking with Deme),and I'm wondering if there are any preconditions(zero friendship points tested,At any friendship level greater than zero friendship points tested,1 heart tested,all failed).骑凤散人 (talk) 21:50, 31 July 2024 (UTC)

Hello! Here is what I can tell you: The dialogue is in `Content/Characters/Dialogue/Demetrius.json`, and the entry is

```
"purchasedAnimal_Dinosaur": "Say that again!? You successfully incubated a dinosaur egg? This is unprecedented!$5#$e#Here, take my coffee, I'm all worked up now... I can't drink any more. [253]"
```

and in Chinese:

```
"purchasedAnimal_Dinosaur": "我没听错吧？！你成功孵化了恐龙蛋？简直是史无前例！$5#$e#来，这杯咖啡就给你了，我现在兴奋得不得了……不能再喝了。[253]"
```

And it's called from `StardewValley.AnimalHouse::adoptAnimal` in the game code. There are no preconditions (other than hatching the first dinosaur egg in a Coop).

I don't know why the dialogue didn't trigger for you, it may be a problem with non-English games, or it may be that another dialogue overwrote it... You may find an answer about why a dialogue gets overwritten here: Modding:Dialogue. Or, maybe not, I don't know...

If you can test a save file in English and Chinese, and see if it triggers, that would be helpful! I can also try to make time to test later tonight.

It would be a good idea to add the reference to the page, I'll do that now (in English). I'm sorry I can't be more helpful! margotbean (talk) 22:13, 31 July 2024 (UTC)

Oh! Also... I think I was playing v1.6.9 when I triggered it, there may be a bug with v1.6.8 that already got fixed in v1.6.9... So, there's that issue complicating things. I will test in v1.6.9 and see if there's a problem, I won't bother testing in v1.6.8. If I find a problem, I will report it for v1.6.9. Thank you again for your comment! margotbean (talk) 22:21, 31 July 2024 (UTC)

## Guidelines on adding hints to wiki pages

Hey there! I recently tried to add more tips to the Qi's Prismatic Grange quest with common items that don't need to be purchased. You reverted this change stating that the tips are only good for players with a lot of cash(?) and that the ones I added depended on playstyle, so I assumed the issue was with how the tips were presented. I rewrote them to clearly distinguish between purchasable items and common/easy to gather items, and you reverted that too with a message saying that the quests page is not a replacement for the dyeing page, which lists all possible items that can be used for this quest.

I'm very unclear on which kinds of tips are fine and which aren't. I felt like my changes were good because:

1. The hints are inside a collapsible block, meaning they don't clutter the page unless a user specifically wants to see the hints.
2. I listed items that are very common (eg. sap, fiber, copper ore, bug meat) and many players will have a stockpile of at least some of them, saving them from having to buy more expensive food items.
3. The dyes page is difficult to scan through, given that it is very dense and not all items are applicable. I just did the quest twice and missed some very easy items by looking through myself. Having a list that highlights items some common items can save players a lot of time if they have them on hand. It saves a lot of time and frustration.
4. The section already contained tips listing the cheapest item to buy in most categories. Why are these fine, but common items aren't? Shouldn't this section be removed too?

In addition, your second revert comment felt arbitrary and really aggressive to me which left me with a very bad feeling :/ Judging by your interactions with other editors on talk pages, you normally seem like a nice and patient person so I don't understand why my edits warranted such a hostile response. I'm just here to help out and improve the wiki where I can. Variant9 (talk) 18:07, 5 August 2024 (UTC)

Hello Variant9! It may have been accidental caps lock, it may have been the summer heat, it may have been that I **reverted the edit once already**, I don't know. I can't tell you which potential future hints are ok and which are not, but I can say the edit in question is a no-go. You claim that the items you listed are easy to obtain, but *again*, this depends solely on playstyle, with players who accept the quest while not in summer having difficult access to blueberries, players who've recently completed the sticky bundle being fresh out of sap, players who regularly turn ore into bars not having large amounts of ore laying around, etc. etc. etc. There are more reasons an item wouldn't be readily available than there are items on the Dyeing page. So, best advice, don't commit an edit a second time if it's been reverted once. Thanks for your comment! margotbean (talk) 20:33, 5 August 2024 (UTC)

## Fall leaves losing

Hello Margotbean!

In the "Version History" for 1.6, there is a note stating that "Some trees have a chance to lose their leaves in the fall." However, in-game, the actual implementation is that oak and maple trees transform into Green Rain Trees type 1 and 2, respectively, and remain so until the next spring. This implies that during this period, the leafless trees cannot have tappers placed on them and do not drop seeds from their original tree types. I believe these changes go beyond simply "lose their leaves". Therefore, I would like to ask your opinion: Do you think these details should be added as "Bug" to the corresponding page? 第二个熺 (talk) 12:26, 11 August 2024 (UTC)

No, I don't think it's a bug, I think it's what ConcernedApe intended. But, the language on the Version History page (and Trees page and Green Rain Trees page too?) could use some more explanation. I'll tackle Version History, if you would like to take care of any other pages that need it, that would be great! margotbean (talk) 20:39, 11 August 2024 (UTC)

## Deluxe Scarecrow Range

Hi Margotbean! I recently edited the deluxe scarecrow page to add a guide on where to place deluxe scarecrows for complete coverage on the forest farm, which got deleted saying "This is 2MB of unnecessary" - Would it be better if I did the same for every farm type? If so, I'd make sure the file size is much smaller (which I thought I did, sorry it didn't work! still learning the ropes). Thank you! SailBoatSea (talk) 19:20, 11 August 2024 (UTC)

Hello! Unfortunately, I think adding to unnecessary would be more unnecessary, so no, I don't think it would be better. But there is a thread on the forums for guides &amp; resources that may be more suitable. Best of luck! margotbean (talk) 20:39, 11 August 2024 (UTC)

## Emily's Outfit Services

Hello Margotbean!

As we see,Emily's Outfit Services is an important part of Desert Festival,but there\`s only two paragraphs of introduction,which is obviously not enough.How about build a table to show all 61 makeover outfits?I know it\`s a big project,trust me,more details means more fun,and it will help thousands of players.Once you agree,code wizard 第二个熺 will make my idea come true.We will update both English wiki and Chinese wiki.骑凤散人 (talk) 11:51, 21 August 2024 (UTC)

## Two Templates

Hello, Margotbean! I would like to respectfully request once again for an update to Template:CraftingRecipes, as it remains unchanged. I sincerely believe that this template can be immensely helpful, providing a convenient way for players to check their "Crafting" list at a glance, rather than uploading saves to Stardew Checkup.

Moreover, I'm also considering the creation of a template for the "Special Items &amp; Powers" page, akin to the template in the Collections section. If you agree with any idea, I will synchronize the changes in all twelve languages. If those ideas doesn't align with your vision, I apologize for any inconvenience. 第二个熺 (talk) 15:42, 21 August 2024 (UTC)

When I weigh the amount of upkeep such templates would cause for the future of the game (and the wiki) and the value they would add, I must say no. margotbean (talk) 20:44, 21 August 2024 (UTC)

## Behaviour of the Seed Maker

Hi there.

I attempted a correction of the page Seed Maker, based on the latest source I could find decompiled (external link omitted, since the wiki doesn't allow them), and available readily. I understand that this (v1.5.4) isn't the latest available version (v1.6.8 build 24119 for the steam platform, at the time of writing), and that changes have been allegedly made, between the two versions, to the code managing random events; so the edit I made cannot stay as-is.

However, the behaviour from the seed maker in the current steam version (v1.6.8) is still 100% reproducible at a given time of a given day, so the information I added concerning the possibility to game the seed maker by "determining when it is best to put seeds in before reloading the game and doing it the optimal way" is still relevant. I do not have access to the code for the version 1.6.8, so I cannot show the source code to justify this; however it is trivial to test in-game.

Mr Qi (talk) 10:12, 30 August 2024 (UTC)

It seems the issue has already been resolved, but I wanted to tell you that anyone with the game on PC can unpack the game files. This will show you the most current version of the game code. margotbean (talk) 19:22, 30 August 2024 (UTC)

Hello again, thanks for your answer. I am aware that DotNet applications can be de-compiled; I'm actually a developer (even if my goofy/obsessive behavior might have made me look childish; which is somewhat surprisingly a very common trait in developers, "amusingly" enough), and I know how to do this. However, I'm playing on the deck, which, as you likely know, doesn't run Microsoft Windows. I do not have a Microsoft Windows machine at all anymore (and yes, I know ILSpy works on "Linux", but it is still *more* work) and while I have the time to goof around on here (very light mental load), I do not have the time to do actual work (higher mental load) for free while I should actually do real work that pays. So, de-compiling the newer versions will have to wait until I have some free time I can allocate to technical tasks, or until someone else does it and uploads it somewhere online and indexed. On an unrelated note, I have written an entire new page for the Seed Maker discussion, detailing the code path and math behind the probabilities calculation, but I cannot create it because of the "New user mass edits protection" (which is a good thing to have, apparently, given a quick look at the moderation logs). Not sure if such a page would help at all, but I thought I'd let you know in case it is a welcome addition. Mr Qi (talk) 07:56, 31 August 2024 (UTC)

Hello again, just a heads up, if you want to check the edit logs from the server side again, I tried adding Wolfram Alpha (so, external) links to the Seed Maker talk page, but the spam filter caught me again. ;) Mr Qi (talk) 15:34, 4 September 2024 (UTC)

## I am confused

Hi Sir! Do we have a rule for adding contents to the history part? I do that work just because I see Triple Shot Espresso works. You really need to explain why other pages cant. They own same source. It's logical. Or I\`m just wasting time here.骑凤散人 (talk) 00:54, 31 August 2024 (UTC)

contents added by 第二个熺‎ same situation! If you check fish seprate pages you\`ll see that all of them in requirements added Aquatic Overpopulation quest part. That means all Crops in requirements adding Crop Order quest IS LOGICAL WORK! You also need to explain this.

We come here to edit because we love SV. But this?it\`s kind of humiliating. Both logic and work.骑凤散人 (talk) 01:19, 31 August 2024 (UTC)

All of those edits will be removed as soon as I have time. margotbean (talk) 01:42, 31 August 2024 (UTC)

You need more specific.MB and GMB items? my edits? or yours?骑凤散人 (talk) 01:49, 31 August 2024 (UTC)

If a quest cannot be prepared for ahead of time, it doesn't need to be listed on the individual page, so the fish edits will be gone. If an item was added in v1.6 (such as mystery boxes) there is no need to add a history section to all the pages for items it may contain. Those edits will be removed. There will always be inconsistency between pages, because there are 12 languages, hundreds of editors, and only one of me. I apologize for not putting a message on your talk page explaining the reason for the edits I made. I thought about it, then got pulled in another direction. margotbean (talk) 02:44, 31 August 2024 (UTC)

I know now.Thanks for your explanation.骑凤散人 (talk) 03:36, 31 August 2024 (UTC)

I am also very confused. What does "a request cannot be prepared for ahead of time" mean? If the meaning is that certain quests require items that are random and cannot be prepared in advance, then the parts related to "Help Wanted", "Raccoon", and "Fish Pond" quests should also be deleted; If it means that certain items required for certain quests must be collected during the quest period, then the content of many Special Order related items should also to be deleted. However, not long ago, I also saw someone adding information related to this to the potato page, and you made corrections to it.

Having said so much, I am curious about which content should be included in the "Quest" section, which content can be included, and which content cannot be included? Actually, I have encountered many problems while maintaining Wiki recently. If I have time later, I will list them all and ask for your opinion.

Maintaining 12 wikis simultaneously is undoubtedly a daunting task. I would like to express my gratitude to you. 第二个熺 (talk) 04:54, 31 August 2024 (UTC)

Thank you, I try to do my best!

Basically, if the information helps a player complete a quest then it can be on the page. If the quest is random and requires a large number of items, then it's not helpful to have it on the page. Saving one potato for a "Help Wanted" quest is reasonable. Buying 100 potato seeds for a Special Order that may or may not happen is not reasonable, so there is not much point to having it on the page. It's the same for the raccoons and dried fruit, it's not reasonable to prepare a dried fruit for every fruit in the game, so there's no point in having it on the page. Fish Pond quests are pre-determined, that is to say, there are very few items that can be chosen, so it's reasonable to let players know they might want to save one of each item, just in case it's needed.

I can't say if every page on the wiki follows these guidelines right now, probably not. But I am still trying to get the wiki up-to-date from v1.6 while also preparing for v1.6.9. So, the inconsistencies will remain for now...

I usually say it will be fixed "within the next 7 years" because that's how long I worked on the wiki before v1.6. If you have specific questions, I will always try to answer them! Thank you! margotbean (talk) 21:42, 31 August 2024 (UTC)

## Recent Quote Reversions

Hello Margotbean,

I noticed you recently undone a few quotes I added to Leah's page - and other quotes - and added a page summary of "NO MORE QUOTES ADDED until editors learn how to read quote files."

I'm not sure what this means exactly. The quotes I added are located within `...\Stardew Valley\Content\Strings\StringsFromCSFiles.xnb` on lines 506, 509, 510, and 511. After numerous encounters, they only seem to occur while Leah is outside on the porch and married to the player.

Is the issue with the fact that numerous villagers can speak these lines, and it would be cumbersome to edit every article with them? Or is the issue that it can't be proven Leah says these lines? There is also an inconsistency present, as the quote `I spent the morning repairing a few of the fences. They should be as good as new.` is also present in Elliot and Shane's articles, but present nowhere else on the site.

Please clarify, thanks. RichyG93 (talk) 05:41, 31 August 2024 (UTC)

Hello Richy! I believe the main problem was that you added quotes mixed in with another editor who repeatedly got the triggers wrong, and I did not have time to keep looking up and correcting them. So, you were a victim of circumstance.

If you know how to read the quote files, and are reasonably certain about the triggers, then please add them to the villagers' pages. If you find quotes common to all spouses, it would be very nice if you would add them to all the marriage candidates' pages. Getting rid of those inconsistencies would be wonderful. margotbean (talk) 21:42, 31 August 2024 (UTC)

Thanks for clarifying! I know for certain that under the conditions above, Leah says these lines. As for how often, and if other requirements are needed for her to say those lines, I'm not certain. I'm also not certain if all other characters say these lines under the same circumstances. I'll try to do some more digging before re-adding the quotes. RichyG93 (talk) 10:22, 1 September 2024 (UTC)

## Questions related to Grange Display

Hello, Margotbean!

I am currently trying to update the "Artisan Goods" section under the "Categories" section on the Stardew Valley Fair page, because the newly added Dried Fruit, Smoked Fish, etc. in 1.6 also have Category points but are not in the list. There are not many issues with updating dried fruits, but smoked fish has, as the price of smoked fish is simultaneously influenced by both Fishing(Fisher and Angler) and Artisan professions. I plan to add new columns to make the table suitable for smoked fish, and connect the icons of the two professions with a plus sign, just like the "Fruit" table. I would like to ask for your opinion first, as I have also noticed that there is currently no information related to smoked fish prices in the Infobox on various fish pages (but I think there should be, just like adding relevant Artisan Goods information to crops). I am not sure if the two are related.

In addition, there are now many types of items under the Luau page. Since the final response is related to the quality, base sell price, and edibility of the items, can we add a table to Luau like "Sell Price &amp; Quality" at the Stardew Valley Fair to help readers understand? 第二个熺 (talk) 18:16, 3 September 2024 (UTC)

I have several edits to make to add Smoked Fish to the wiki, but I have to research the sell prices in-game and in the game code first. There are several changes that must be made before the Stardew Valley Fair page would be able to be changed. It's on the "to do" list!

The last time I looked at the code for the Luau, there were complex "if" statements that determine the governor's response, based on sell price and edibility. I'm not sure how that would look in a table that's easy to understand. Maybe if you make a mockup on your user page, I could see what we're talking about. margotbean (talk) 18:48, 3 September 2024 (UTC)

Well, I only noticed today that the table under "Categories" used templates... so forget about the change plan I mentioned earlier regarding smoked fish, which obviously didn't work. Besides, the table doesn't seem to be strictly arranged in alphabetical order, so I'm not sure where to add items like dried fruits. Maybe I need to rearrange the table in alphabetical order when adding new items? Or is the table arranged in some other way?

Regarding the plan to add a table to the Luau page, I'm putting it on hold for now, because as you said, it's not easy to create a table that simply expresses the final result based on the base price, quality, and edibility (moreover, we can't directly add edibility to the page, which is not displayed in the normal game, and it must first be converted into healing points). I think an immature edit should not be added to the wiki. 第二个熺 (talk) 16:14, 4 September 2024 (UTC)

The "Artisan Goods" section is arranged roughly alphabetically, but with similar items grouped together. All Dried Fruit should go right before "Honey (Wild)". The table is sortable, if people want to sort everything strictly alphabetically. margotbean (talk) 18:16, 4 September 2024 (UTC)

## Table Sorting for Alphabetical Order

To take a tangent from the grange display discussion above, I would like to mention that the Wiki does not sort power book names strictly on the Books page. The problem is that several book names use "The" as the first word, and the sorter thus lists them under T's, while strict sorting rules omit consideration of initial "a", "an" and "the". I guess I find that annoying, so I bring it up because someone else might also. But it would seem that it may be worthy of thinking how many other tables might be adversely affected by the same thing, and to reconsider the alphabetization method. Giles (talk) 21:00, 4 September 2024 (UTC)

Mediawiki doesn't seem to provide for this problem, other than adding a `data-sort-value` to affected tables. In other circumstances, the name of the book would be listed like "Alleyway Buffet, The" but I don't think that would be a good solution here. Instead, you can just add data-sort-values to any affected table. margotbean (talk) 23:49, 4 September 2024 (UTC)

Thanks. That explains the table problem. I assume the code would be entered for each Description item in a table that needs to be sorted differently from the default? But not knowing anything about Mediawiki, I'd rather not mess with it. This is the "sort" of techno-fussiness I just don't have any remaining patience for. I leave it to the younger editors who want to fill their heads with those tediums. All the best to anyone who wants to give it a shot! Giles (talk) 17:22, 5 September 2024 (UTC)

I gave it a shot, hopefully the table now sorts properly. Cheese80 (talk) 17:37, 13 September 2024 (UTC)

Looks good! margotbean (talk) 21:23, 13 September 2024 (UTC)

## Create Pages

Hello margotbean!  
I would like to copy and paste the Modding:Modder Guide into the Chinese wiki (the recent changes in the Chinese wiki you can see what I mean directly). By doing so it would be possible to fill in the missing pages in the guide. However, I also realized that you deleted some of those pages before, so I'm informing you of the changes that I will be made. At the same time, I am asking for your opinion about the changes. I hope my bad English didn't cause any trouble for you. Candybear (talk) 02:11, 8 September 2024 (UTC)

Hello Candybear! I have no problems with what you're doing. I can find only one page that I deleted, from an editor who made no other changes, because the page was formatted very badly and not translated. I think they copied from the English webpage without viewing the source code. (They didn't know what they were doing.)

Please continue, and let me know if you ever have any specific questions! margotbean (talk) 11:24, 8 September 2024 (UTC)

Ok, I kown. One more thing: if I change the Modding:Modder Guide/header page in Chinese wiki, will other pages using "{{../../header}}" also be automatically changed? Sorry, I really don't know, hope you can answer it.

Thank you for your reply.Candybear (talk) 14:37, 8 September 2024 (UTC)

Yes, all pages that use 模组:制作指南/header will be automatically updated if you change it. 👍 margotbean (talk) 15:06, 8 September 2024 (UTC)

Thank you, now I understand it at all.👌Candybear (talk) 15:24, 8 September 2024 (UTC)

## Suggestions to the History section of Pierre's store

Hello, I was on the page of Pierre's store and I have noticed some things missing. Firstly, there was a typo that ommitted the word "been" in the "closed" section, which I added and submitted in the recent change, I also marked said edit as minor. However, there was some information missing regarding the version history, the editing guidelines said this sort of change was major and required discussion beforehand, especially considering that the new information needs to be translated to different languages. With this in mind, I am writing to you to propose the changes I want to make. I think the 1.6 bug fixes for 2 common exploits should be mentioned on the page: 1) "Fixed exploit that made it possible to keep temporary items like Qi Fruit by selling them to Pierre and rebuying them the following day." 2) "Fixed exploit that allowed the player to purchase their previously sold artisan goods at a cheaper price the day after changing their profession from Artisan through the use of Statue of Uncertainty." Funny Fox (talk) 03:37, 10 September 2024 (UTC)

Good suggestion, I've added them to the page. Thanks! margotbean (talk) 17:26, 10 September 2024 (UTC)

## Long time no see

```
    Hey. It's me, Mortician Technician. Just with a different name. A while back, I had wanted to edit the chicken and other animal's pages to include the aspects of pet relationships, and how they interact with the quality of items they produce. However, I had gone dark soon after. I was browsing through, and noticed they still had.t been updated, And I was wondering If I could finish what I had started, even after a year or so. I'm very, very sorry I ghosted you all. life had gotten rough, and I got low. but I'm back, and wanted to finally help and contribute as I had planned. Once again, I am so, so, so sorry. especially to you, Margotbean.

Medicinal arsenic (talk) 9:03, Sep 20, 2024

Hello again! No apologies are necessary, life interrupts the best plans for all of us sometimes.

What you have on your user page is a lot of advice-giving and not really objectively written text. When you remove that, what you have left is basically what's written on the Animals page, which all the animals' pages link to as the main page (*i.e.,* the "Produce" section is a short summary that links to the main article "Animals#Produce"). So, I don't think the pages are lacking info, and no changes are necessary.

I appreciate your desire to make the wiki better for everyone! margotbean (talk) 16:55, 20 September 2024 (UTC)

Perfect, thank you. I missed being on here, to be fair. And you're just a wonderful person to talk to. Very, very helpful, too. I'm always hanging around, and I have other things to be doing, so I'm happy I could've at least been of assistance a while back. I hope you're doing well, and if you ever want to chat, I'm always here. (I like making friends)

## Suggestion for the Greenhouse page

I noticed in my game that after the trees are fully grown that you CAN place items next to them and they don't prevent fruit from growing. So I discovered that you can put garden pots in there for more growing space... they can't have ancient fruit in them but it's a good way to get more out of your greenhouse.

Dlcnate1 (talk) 00:56, 24 September 2024 (UTC)

I think the details of what to put in the greenhouse fall under advice-giving, and the fact that objects don't impede fruit trees from increasing in quality is covered on the Fruit Trees page (and the Garden Pot page). So, not really appropriate for the greenhouse page. margotbean (talk) 17:55, 24 September 2024 (UTC)

## Strawberry Page Edits

Why did you remove the crop calendars for planting on Spring 13/14? Its the reason why I and many others visit the Strawberry page, especially newer players. It follows the format for crop pages and helps the viewer visually confirm the amount of harvests they get. Overall I see this as a completely unnecessary removal that worsens the readability of the page. Please consider reverting this, thanks. Trendisty (talk) 02:16, 25 September 2024 (UTC)

I appreciate your feedback, but I stand behind the change (which was carried out in all 12 languages *4 months ago*). The good news for you is that nothing on the wiki ever disappears. Go to the Strawberry page, click on "View history" at the top right, then click on the date just before the change, in this case "12:59, 19 April 2024‎". You should see the page as it was before the change. For your convenience, this is the link: https://stardewvalleywiki.com/mediawiki/index.php?title=Strawberry&amp;oldid=168102

Go and tell many others to bookmark that page. margotbean (talk) 06:46, 26 September 2024 (UTC)

## Adding Reminder Message

Hello margotbean! It seems that some of the new editors of the Chinese wiki have not read Help:Editing. Anyway they create some messes to the point where it takes a lot of effort to fix it up. Could you remind new editors to read Help:Editing at the top of the editing tool before they make their first edit(By adding a reminder message), please?

A million thanks!!! Candybear (talk) 15:51, 27 September 2024 (UTC)

Yes, this is a good idea in all languages. I feel your pain.

I will do research to see if there's a way to add a message without installing a mediawiki extension on the server side. margotbean (talk) 18:06, 27 September 2024 (UTC)

I think there is a other reason that make new editors confused. I asked more than 20 of my friends yesterday. They told me a similar and unbelievable thing, they don't konw Wikipedia or other sites like it. I'm sorry to hear that, but Main Land China blocked Wikipedia since 2015. So they maybe creat lots of messes when they try to edit firstly.

I want to create a new page to explain Help:Editing(on my user page), and hope new editors don't feel confused at all. Hope you could allow my requestion, please. And thank you for you hard work! Candybear (talk) 15:15, 29 September 2024 (UTC)

The problem is that the vast majority of bad edits are made by people who don't read "Help:Editing", so they wouldn't read any additional pages either. It's a problem in all languages. margotbean (talk) 17:42, 29 September 2024 (UTC)

Update: I have done some research, and I can add a message above the edit window. However, it is not dismissable for experienced editors, and it does not show up on mobile. So, I'm still looking for a good solution. margotbean (talk) 20:37, 29 September 2024 (UTC)

You're right, we can't force people to read Help:Editing.

Hope we can find a better way to solve it. Good luck! Candybear (talk) 21:38, 29 September 2024 (UTC)

## About color

Hi Sir!Do you know how to write HSV code like this? (dyed RGB value 112,38,22)

Relax,I\`m not going to update Emily's Outfits table, just doing my color research.Thank you!骑凤散人 (talk) 19:32, 27 September 2024 (UTC)

There are many converters out there (to convert from HSL to RGB or html hex code, etc.), but none of them correspond to the system of sliders that ConcernedApe implemented in the game. His system is unique. margotbean (talk) 23:42, 27 September 2024 (UTC)

Thanks for your answering. If I tell you I have found the correct converter, would it be a big surprise? I already tested many times and successed. It\`s not unique, It\`s HSV system, which is mentioned in 1.4 changelog. And It\`s also writen in the game code. My question is, Is it possible to write HSV code with a background color same as RGB112,38,22 in this website? I just want to write them on my own page.骑凤散人 (talk) 00:33, 28 September 2024 (UTC)

You can use HSL but not HSV. A simple internet search for "CSS HSV" would give you the answer, so I'm confused as to why you're asking me the question while at the same time swearing that you're not planning something.... margotbean (talk) 17:03, 28 September 2024 (UTC)

Because of topic 93. I'm sorry to have failed to make myself clear. I just don't want you to think that I am still secretly working on that 61 makeover outfits table. Well,thanks again to answer my question.骑凤散人 (talk) 22:40, 28 September 2024 (UTC)

## About editing

I noticed I got banned from editing for repeated sloppy edits. Do you have any advice on how to edit better? Thank you, and I'm sorry for editing badly. - Insanity (talk) 00:34, 30 September 2024 (UTC)

I think you should read Help Editing before editing and know what pages this wiki has. Candybear (talk) 14:25, 30 September 2024 (UTC)

Oh, yeah. Thanks, Candybear. - Insanity (talk) 14:37, 30 September 2024 (UTC)

I read it. Seems like I missed a lot of important information. If I can edit again, I will keep that information in mind. Thanks again, Candybear. - Insanity (talk) 14:49, 30 September 2024 (UTC)

You're welcome!

I hope you can be unblocked soon, but I can't make a decision to unblock you, you shuold ask margotbean about it. Candybear (talk) 15:13, 30 September 2024 (UTC)

## About getting banned

Hey margotbean, I got banned for sloppy edits. I have read help:editing and realize that I missed some important information. Could I have another chance at editing? I am very sorry for my bad edits. - Insanity (talk) 22:46, 1 October 2024 (UTC)

## A New Suggetion

Hello margotbean! Can we add a message to remind new editors to read "help editing" to the welcome screen after registered users, so that it should be visible to both mobile and desktop users. I'm not good at server stuff, so I'm asking for your help. Thank you, Candybear (talk) 09:00, 2 October 2024 (UTC)

That's not my area, but I can ask the server people about it. margotbean (talk) 17:14, 2 October 2024 (UTC)

## Username changing

Does anyone know how I can change my username? I can't find anywhere that I can. - Insanity (talk) 23:44, 3 October 2024 (UTC)

That's because you cannot change it, unfortunately. margotbean (talk) 17:32, 4 October 2024 (UTC)

## Suggesting but not editing

Hey margotbean, I'm banned, but I had an idea. What if I just use the talk pages to suggest edits so you and other better editors could determine if they are needed? That way I can still contribute without messing up the wiki! - Caviar (talk) 18:57, 6 October 2024 (UTC)

Oh my dear Caviar, why do you think I did not ban you from the talk namespaces? Additionally, you have made 3 suggestions today, to 3 different pages, so I don't understand the purpose of your comment on my talk page. I check all edits in all 12 languages every day. Just because I haven't responded to all of them doesn't mean I haven't seen them. margotbean (talk) 19:31, 6 October 2024 (UTC)

Thank you so much! I really appreciate not being banned from those. I really appreciate all the work you do. Thank you a million times and more!!! - Caviar (talk) 19:43, 6 October 2024 (UTC)

## Can fxking stop this fxking Insanity Studios using talk pages?

Take a look of our wiki! Such a mess! WTF! Who is the fxking Insanity Studios? A SV Professor? APE? Suggesting his mom! Hey Insanity Studios, Stop pooping trashtalk on talk pages! Go to hell!

What are you fxking doing dear admin margotbean? No blocking this nuts? As a Admin but don\`t know how to use power,such a disappointment! It\`s Siki incident happened again!骑凤散人 (talk) 00:46, 9 October 2024 (UTC)

## Clam Apology

Sorry for changing Evelyn’s liking of clams to being a hated gift. I didn’t realize gifts changed in the 1.6 so I’ll be aware of that next time before I do anything.

Sincerely, SuperLyon31 SuperLyon31 (talk) 17:23, 17 October 2024 (UTC)

## Hey Margotbean, Just a reply to your comment! (Please read..)

I did not know there were admins on here..Anyway, Thanks for telling me about the Edit:Help page. Because I had no idea I wasn’t supposed to do that.. thank you for the help. I’m new here and without you I would’ve had no idea on the rules, Thanks a million. Bye!

## Margotbean I have a question

Just read the Edit Help page, Uhh..Is Opinions on talk pages allowed? Or not allowed at all..?

## Incorrect information on Holy Blade

The Holy Blade (https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Holy\_Blade) is obtainable on console. I know because I got it and came here to see what it is. 🙃 I don't know how to edit and didn't want to mess anything up, so thought this would be better. Renf (talk) 15:49, 5 November 2024 (UTC)

## Sea Urchin and Lionfish names in RU

Hello! I see you was confused by 2 very similar fish names in RU version: Морской еж (Sea Urchin) and Морской ерш (Lionfish) (romanized Morskoy yozh and Morskoy yorsh). This is the main reason I renamed the latter to Крылатка (Krylatka). Also the new name not only help to distinguish these 2 fishes, it is also the correct one because Morskoy yorsh refers to completely different fish: Sea Scorpion.--Quicksilver (talk) 12:45, 27 November 2024 (UTC)

Aha! Thank you for the explanation. But I still don't know if any page names need to be changed on the wiki or not -- there are two entries in the table for "Smoked Fish", and there is no page created yet in Russian... 🤔 margotbean (talk) 14:29, 27 November 2024 (UTC)

I've fixed the table, it's all within the smoked fish row now. The 'smoked fish' term wasn't changed, it is just custom flavored names which was added to better match the gender of the particular fish ('Копченый {1}' is the default masculine form and if fish has feminine gender, there is an entry for it in this table). Jelly, Juice, Smoked Fish, Dried Fruit, Honey, Pickles, Wine – they all retained its general name which was used before 1.6.9, but name for the particular flavor now can be written more grammatically correct. --Quicksilver (talk) 14:59, 27 November 2024 (UTC)

I see, thank you for the explanation and for keeping the wikis up to date! margotbean (talk) 17:12, 27 November 2024 (UTC)

## Jewels of the Sea and Willy

You have done more editing than anyone else on the Jewels of the Sea page so I'm reporting this here.

In the gifting section Willy is in both the Love and Neutral lists. Not having the book I cannot determine which is accurate. Corvus (talk) 17:20, 27 November 2024 (UTC)

Fixed; he loves the book. Thank you!! margotbean (talk) 17:24, 27 November 2024 (UTC)

That was quick. Just noticed Elliot is in twice as well.

Fixed, Thank you!! margotbean (talk) 19:40, 27 November 2024 (UTC)

## Revision on my recent edit

Hello, I believe one of my recent edits was falsely reverted due to the fact not being true, but I can confirm it was (see: https://www.polygon.com/news/474732/stardew-valley-1-6-multiplayer-mode-mobile-ios-android)

Here is the link to the edit: https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Special:MobileDiff/181634

Would it be better if I clarified by saying something like "Added experimental support for Android" WikiMagic1956 (talk) 18:44, 30 November 2024 (UTC)

As I understand it, mobile multiplayer is in beta, and may never be released into production, so it's not appropriate to add it to version history at all yet. Although I think it's unlikely that it will never be released, it's a possibility. margotbean (talk) 03:58, 1 December 2024 (UTC)

## Legendary fish pond image

Hello! I've noticed that the file Legendaryfishponds.jpg lacks color information about Ms.Angler, but I'm unable to make changes to it. May I ask if you will allow me to upload an improved version? Thank you.VulpesLucida (talk) 12:48, 6 December 2024 (UTC)

It actually seems to be due to the cache. I will re-upload it later. I apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused. VulpesLucida (talk) 03:49, 7 December 2024 (UTC)

Hello VL, I apologize for the delay in my response! As you have figured out, there is a significant delay when uploading images -- the new version may not show up for 5 hours. This is a chronic problem without an obvious solution, unfortunately. Thank you for your understanding! margotbean (talk) 16:24, 7 December 2024 (UTC)

## The deleted sentences of my edit

Hello Margotbean,

I'd like to explain my intention of sentences such as "a qualified Goat can produce Large Milk per teo days" and hear your thought🙏

I found a similar sentence in Void Egg article saying: *The Void Egg is an animal product obtained from a Void Chicken. **It produces one Void Egg per day if fed on the prior day, like all other chickens.*** So I thought other animals' articles should have corresponding sentences, and I tried to add them. Becoming awkward expression is because of my English skill, I think.

So now, I'd like to know your thought about it. If such sentences are no longer needed, it has to be removed from Void Egg article; Otherwise, it has to be added to other articles.

Mmtraa7 (talk) 16:51, 13 December 2024 (UTC)

Hello Mmtraa! Please forgive me for not messaging you first! The problem with your edits was the use of "it" as the subject. The first sentence talks about the animal product, then the next sentence talks about the animal, and the third sentence switches back to the animal product. But the 3rd sentence uses "it" as the subject, so it's not clear whether the "it" means the animal or the egg!

The Void Egg page suffers from the same problem, but it's not as confused for some reason. I honestly think it would be better to leave the info on the animals' pages, and not on the egg/milk pages, tbh. margotbean (talk) 21:33, 13 December 2024 (UTC)

Hello and thank you for your reply! I understand you have so many things to do, so please never mind it ;)

Yes you are completely true on that confusing "it" ! Actually I also had felt this might be matter, but I had no better idea on expression and went with it...

Recently I've read the Animals article and each animals' pages, and confirmed all of them refer to the producing cycle. So, I think the sentence about producing cycle on Void Egg page could be removed, as you say (because Void Chicken page certainly has the same information). I would edit English and Japanese Wiki, which I can edit! Mmtraa7 (talk) 15:24, 14 December 2024 (UTC)

You're awesome, thank you!! margotbean (talk) 16:23, 14 December 2024 (UTC)

Glorb (talk) hello margot, i added bouncer to the occupants in the oasis, why would you remove it if it's correct?

Hello Glorb! It's not correct -- the bouncer is more of a door lock than an occupant of the Oasis. margotbean (talk) 22:43, 14 December 2024 (UTC)

## Edits on Crops, Spring, and Summer

Hi margotbean, I’m not really sure why you undid the edits I performed in those pages, so I thought I’d explain why I did them.

Crops

My first edit was to correct the gold/day value for summer squash. The value of data-sort-value="12.85"&gt;12.85g/d on the page is wrong, or at the very least, I have no idea how this value was obtained, but it does not seem to follow the formula from Crops#Gold per Day. Though rather than just state it's wrong, I think it would be best if I showed my work so you can double check it; perhaps I got something wrong.

Calculation for Summer Squash

Max Harvests = 8

Sell Price per Harvest = data-sort-value="45"&gt;45g

Seed Price = data-sort-value="0"&gt;0g

Growing Days = 6d + ((8 − 1) × 3d) = 27d

Gold per Day = (8 × data-sort-value="45"&gt;45g − data-sort-value="0"&gt;0g) / 27d ≈ data-sort-value="13.33"&gt;13.33g/d

My other two edits were simply adding `≈` to `-20.74`, `20.77`, `25.56`, and `-5.63` because it was missing; all of these are rounded values after all. All the other rounded values in the page already use `≈`, making these four the exception, so these edits were strictly for the formatting.

Spring

My first edit here was simply to replace the data-sort-value="0"&gt;0g for the carrot entry with `N/A`. This was to mirror exactly what you did in the Winter page with your edit for the powdermelon entry, so I thought I would do the same here for consistency (carrot seeds also cannot be bought from Pierre's after all).

My next three edits were to make the formatting and order of the data for the coffee bean, unmilled rice, and strawberry entries consistent with the formatting and order seen in Summer#Multiple Harvests, Crops#Unmilled Rice, and Crops#Strawberry, and once again to add `≈` where it was missing.

My final edit, where I shortened the text in the strawberry entry, was motivated by how the table looked quite cramped after my other edits, and by how this same information is presented in Crops#Strawberry.

Summer

My first edit was to also correct the gold/day value of the summer squash value, which presents the completely different value of data-sort-value="18"&gt;18g/d. I also have no idea how that value was obtained, but it too does not seem to follow the formula from Crops#Gold per Day. The other change I did was to replace the data-sort-value="0"&gt;0g with `N/A` for the same reasons as I did in the Spring page.

My second edit was also to make the formatting and order of the data in the coffee bean entry consistent with the formatting seen in Crops#Coffee Bean, and once again to add `≈` where it was missing.

I hope this makes sense. I marked most of these edits as minor because I didn't think any of them modified the meaning of the article. The only edits that I didn't mark as minor were the ones where I changed the gold/day value for the summer squash in the Summer and Crops pages.

P.S. While originally attempting to post this, I got stopped by the "Mass edit by new user" abuse rule, so I broke it down into smaller edits. Alt (talk) 17:59, 23 December 2024 (UTC)

I will look at it after the holidays! margotbean (talk) 20:06, 23 December 2024 (UTC)

## Fandom Wiki Talk, Mostly

Hello Margotbean, this is mostly regarding the ancient Fandom Wiki. I apologize for the how lengthy this message is. I get overly-detailed for the sake of context sometimes.

2 months ago or so I started playing Stardew Valley and inevitably, I came across this wiki in my search to enhance gameplay and discovery. However, I quickly decided to search for a Fandom Wiki site because I prefer Fandom's web and interface designs. Though I have no idea what this one is like for editors; I just always found super wide wikis with square tables and thin borders everywhere not to my taste. I didn't know Minerva existed until today though...

Anyhow, there was a problem: Fandom Wiki was barely updated past 2018. Pre-discovery that the community had moved over to here years ago, I took it upon myself to adopt it and haven't stopped improving it since. Nearly every day, all day. But it occurred to me recently that communities don't simply abandon a project like that to start anew very willingly, and there is more often a painful reason why.

So a couple days ago I decided I'll find out why, but I couldn't find any clear answers. If it isn't awful of me to ask nor too-politically-heated of a subject for wiki chatting, may I know the story behind the move? That is if you know why and feel empowered to tell?

I really care about this game, and I thought it would be wonderful to help out the Fandom Wiki; myself and others still hang about there. My impression was that people who moved wikis encouraged everyone else too, and I know now about Fandom's policy regarding deleting Wiki's and it wouldn't surprise me if it was a Terms of Use disagreement or something similarly. "Only the ones they decide to delete" will be deleted, creators can't. I read a tiny amount about their user data collection policies, which seemed concerning, but I didn't dive into it.

At this point, I've spent SO MUCH TIME making new things for it. Amazing projects I'm quite proud of. New infobox css and templates, table designs, even a new site logo with a photoshop program and pixel-drawing a Lava Monkey icon because I couldn't find one anywhere. I haven't ever done these things before but I'm learning quite fast; I've already dived into CSS styling after a month. I love doing it, for now. But I don't want to be doing it for just my own selfish hyperfixation, particularly if I might be disrespecting, undermining, or disregarding the original wiki creators and any potential hurt ache they went through.

So, I came here to explore this wiki a little more than just grabbing some icons. I still can't tolerate the Vector skin, but the MinervaNeue one looks like it could be my cup of Stardrop Tea. It looks rather under-designed, as though it's capbilities for a wonderful styling is large enough. I'm curious if any of my current or future skills could be helpful here and if so, I'd be happy to transfer over my efforts and projects to improve Minerva, if that is even a thing happening. I can also be just as happy continuing my adoption of the Fandom Wiki too, as there are still folks who like it there and would appreciate it.

Anyway, that was a lot. I hope you are enjoying your holidays. If you don't celebrate, then I hope your you-time has been wonderful.

Take care, StarSnack (talk) 23:38, 24 December 2024 (UTC)

## Problem with Raisins

Hi, Margotbean! I didn't know exactly where to send this, so sorry if I should say this in another place.

In the Evelyn page (english), the raisins are linked normaly; but in the portuguese version, it links to an unexistent raisins page instead of the "passas" page. When I went to edit the spanish version, it happened the same thing; didn't link to the "pasas" page. I'm new here so I don't know how to fix it. Thanks in advance!

The links seem fine, so I'm sorry, I don't understand the problem! margotbean (talk) 23:44, 30 December 2024 (UTC)

That's actually very weird! Maybe it was just a bug? I added the Woody's Secret to Robin's portuguese page now and it's the same thing that was happening with Evelyn's page, should I just give it time perhaps? Venusmorreu (talk) 02:49, 31 December 2024 (UTC)
