Pierre's Missing Stocklist Pierre might be interested in this. Information Source Qi's Walnut Room for data-sort-value="50"&gt; 50 Sell Price *Cannot be sold*

**Pierre's Missing Stocklist** lets Pierre sell seeds from all seasons year-round in his shop. It can be purchased from Qi's Walnut Room for data-sort-value="50"&gt; 50.

Seeds sold out-of-season cost 50% more than they would if in-season. The price of Pierre's year-round stock is unaffected.

The stocklist needs to be delivered to Pierre to work. Trying to give it to anyone other than Pierre displays a message "\[Villager] looks puzzled..." The new inventory items become available for purchase immediately after giving Pierre the stocklist.
