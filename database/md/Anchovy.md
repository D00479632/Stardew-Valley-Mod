The **Anchovy** is a fish that can be caught in the ocean at The Beach or on the Beach Farm during Spring and Fall. At higher fishing levels, casting less than the maximum distance may increase the chances of hooking an anchovy.

Anchovy can be caught regardless of season using Magic Bait.

Anchovy can randomly be found in Garbage Cans during Spring and Fall.
