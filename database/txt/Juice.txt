Juice is an Artisan Good made from placing ingredients inside a Keg, taking approximately 4 days. Its selling price is the base value of the vegetable or foraged item input multiplied by 2.25 (3.15 with the Artisan profession).
The energy and health restored by Juice is equal to 2 × Base Ingredient Value for edible vegetables and foraged items. For inedible vegetables, Juice will restore energy equal to exactly Base Vegetable Value and health equal to 45% Base Vegetable Value.[1] The color of the Juice also depends on the item used.
Although Wheat, Hops, and Tea Leaves are classified as vegetables, when used with a Keg, they produce Beer, Pale Ale, and Green Tea respectively.
The following foraged items can be made into Juice: Cave Carrot, Dandelion, Ginger, Hazelnut, Leek, Spring Onion, Snow Yam, Wild Horseradish, and Winter Root.
Juice cannot be put in a cask.
