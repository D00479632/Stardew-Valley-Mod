## Tailoring

Hops is used in the spool of the Sewing Machine with Cloth in the feed to create a dyeable Shirt and Belt. It is a green dye when used in the spool of the Sewing Machine with a dyeable clothing item in the feed. It can be placed in the green dye pot at Emily's and Haley's house for use in dyeing.

## Tips

- Hops give the 2nd best experience for leveling up Farming skill in a single season, giving 102 to 126 points, depending on speed growth fertilizers. (Mature Ancient Fruit gives the most farming XP.)
- Selling Hops Starter made from the Seed Maker can be more profitable than selling the Hops directly, and also potentially generates Ancient Seeds. Pale Ale and Pickled Hops are more profitable, but the Seed Maker takes only 20 in-game minutes.
