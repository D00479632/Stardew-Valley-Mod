**Bugs (dangerous)** are an enemy found in the Mines after activating the Shrine of Challenge or during the Danger In The Deep quest. 80 cave insects (any type) need to be killed for the Monster Eradication Goal at the Adventurer's Guild.

## Behavior

They initially behave similar to their weaker counterpart the Bug. They fly up and down or left and right in a fixed path. Once they get hit they will rotate and change their flight path, potentially hitting the player.

## Strategy

Hit them from the front as to not get hit once they rotate.
