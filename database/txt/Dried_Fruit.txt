Dried Fruit is an Artisan Good made from placing Fruits inside a Dehydrator, taking one in-game day. Dried Fruit is always normal quality.
The amount of Energy and Health restored from Dried Fruit is 3 times the base fruit Energy/Health restoration. The color of Dried Fruit is also determined by the base fruit used.

Profitability
Since the Dehydrator requires 5 fruit per use, the sell price of Dried Fruit is (1.5 x Fruit Base Price + 5) per fruit used. With the Artisan Profession, the sell price is (2.1 x Fruit Base Price + 7) per fruit used.
Since sell price is based on Fruit Base Price alone, the profit compared to selling the raw fruit will decrease for fruit of higher quality, and from the Tiller Profession.
For example, if neither the Artisan nor Tiller Professions are chosen, iridium quality fruit will generally make a loss if dehydrated, and gold quality will make a profit of only 5g per fruit.
