Mastery Cave

Closed: Never Address: Cindersap Forest Occupants: None

The **Mastery Cave** is an area located in Cindersap Forest. It is unlocked after the player has achieved level 10 in all 5 skills. It can be accessed right after the player reaches level 10 on the fifth skill; there is no need to wait until the next day. Inside, the player finds a letter from Grandpa in the southeast corner, a pedestal in the middle of the cave that reads "The Last Path" and displays the mastery progress bar, and the five pillars, each describing a mastery of a skill.

If the player attempts to enter before reaching level 10 in all skills, a message will display: *Only a master of the five ways may enter (X/5)*, where X is the number of skills in which the player has already reached level 10.

If the player does not enter the Mastery Cave the day they reach level 10 in all skills, as the player wakes up the next day there will be a message saying "You sense that a new way is open...".

## Grandpa's Letter

In the southeast corner Grandpa has left a letter for the farmer. The letter will read the following:

“ “My dear &lt;player's name&gt;,

If you're reading this note, you've found the secret room I've prepared for you. Within these walls are tips, recipes, and even some of my most cherished tools... all the very best from the many happy years I spent in the valley.

By coming this far, you'll have proven that you possess the skill and wisdom to make good use of these powerful secrets. I hope my discoveries help you in your journey to making &lt;Farm's name&gt; a shining star of the whole world!

Make me proud!”

— Grandpa

## Masteries

Mastery points are used to unlock a series of masteries. Each mastery is associated with one skill, and each is represented on a pillar on the cave's back wall. At any time, the player can view the special items and benefits associated with a mastery by visiting its pillar.

Mastery points are equivalent to "excess" skill experience points, above those needed to achieve the initial level 10 skills. They are accumulated only after reaching level 10 in every skill. Farming experience points only contribute to mastery points at a 50% rate, while experience points for the rest of the skills contribute to mastery points at a 100% rate. Experience points after reaching level 10 in all skills that were earned playing an earlier version of the game (before v1.6) do *not* carry over as mastery points.

Experience points are collected and grouped as a single quantity regardless of the skill type associated with the experience, and may be used to claim any mastery. A mastery can be claimed at a pillar only when a sufficient number of mastery points has been accumulated. The player may pick which masteries to claim in any order. Each mastery claimed costs progressively more mastery points than the previous one, defining five levels of costs. The player can track the current progress towards the next level in the Skills tab.

The following table shows the costs to unlock each mastery:

Level Mastery Points Required for This Level Total Mastery Points Required Through This Level 1 10,000 10,000 2 15,000 25,000 3 20,000 45,000 4 25,000 70,000 5 30,000 100,000

When the player accumulates enough mastery points to claim a new mastery, the game shows a message saying "You've reached a new level of understanding...". The cave's pillars are then available for claiming a mastery of the player's choice. After reaching a new mastery level, the mastery experience bar refreshes immediately, so the player does *not* need to go the Mastery Cave to claim a mastery before progressing towards unlocking another mastery; theoretically, they can earn 100,000 Mastery points before claiming any mastery and then claim all five at once.

Masteries achieved are shown on the Special Items &amp; Powers tab of the player's inventory.
