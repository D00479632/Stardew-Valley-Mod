Trap Bobber Causes fish to escape slower when you aren't reeling them in. Information Source Fish Shop • Crafting • SquidFest festival Sell Price data-sort-value="200"&gt;200g Crafting Recipe Source Fishing (Level 6) Ingredients Copper Bar (1) Sap (10)

The **Trap Bobber** is a tackle that helps fishing by causing the progress bar to decrease 33% slower (50% if the player is using an Advanced Iridium Rod with 2 Trap Bobbers) when the fish isn't within the fishing bar, reducing a fish's ability to escape.\[1] It can be crafted or purchased from Willy's Fish Shop for data-sort-value="500"&gt;500g after reaching Fishing level 6. It may also randomly appear at the Traveling Cart for data-sort-value="200"600–1,000g. One Trap Bobber is the copper tier reward on the 13th for the SquidFest festival.

Only the Iridium Rod or the Advanced Iridium Rod can equip tackle. The Iridium Rod can only attach one tackle at a time, while the Advanced Iridium Rod can attach two. To attach tackle, left-click on the tackle, then right-click on the rod. To remove tackle, first right-click to remove any bait, then right-click to remove the tackle. For an Advanced Iridium Rod, the left tackle will be the first one removed.

Tackle does not stack in inventory or chests; each tackle takes up one inventory slot.
