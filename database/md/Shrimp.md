## Tailoring

Shrimp can be used in the spool of the Sewing Machine to create the dyeable Sailor Shirt. It can also be used as a red dye in the dye pots, located at Emily's and Haley's house, 2 Willow Lane.

## Fish Pond

Shrimp can be placed in a Fish Pond, where they will reproduce every 2 days. The initial pond capacity is 3 fish, but the capacity can be increased to 10 by completing three quests. Typical output includes pink Shrimp Roe, Seaweed, and various Trash items, but more valuable items are possible starting at population 5.
