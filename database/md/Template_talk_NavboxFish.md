## Crab Pot Fish Under Ocean/The Beach

I am just wondering, should the Crab Pot fish actually be under The Beach/Ocean section? Before 1.5 came out, that was the only place where saltwater Crab Pot fish could be caught, so it made some sense that it was there. However, now that they can be caught in other places like Ginger Island &amp; The Beach Farm, I think we should probably take them out of that section due to inconsistency. If not, then we would have to put the freshwater crab pot fish into the respective places they could technically be caught, etc., to keep everything consistent, but that would reduce readability of the template in my opinion.

I think we can remove crab pot fish from The Beach section. margotbean (talk) 18:04, 19 April 2022 (UTC)
