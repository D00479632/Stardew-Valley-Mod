## Tailoring

Summer Squash Seeds are not used in any tailoring. They can be used in dyeing, serving as an orange dye at the dye pots located in Emily's and Haley's house, 2 Willow Lane. They can also be used as a brown dye when used in the spool of the Sewing Machine with a dyeable clothing item in the feed.
