Ingredients
Wheat Flour (1)
Sugar (1)
Egg (1)
Chocolate Cake is a cooked dish. It is prepared using either the kitchen inside an upgraded farmhouse or a Cookout Kit. Three Chocolate Cakes are the reward for completing the 2,500 Bundle in the Vault.
Note: this recipe is profitable - it will always result in profit if using the lowest quality Egg as well as Wheat Flour and Sugar from the Mill.
Chocolate Cake may randomly appear in Krobus' shop on Saturdays, in the Garbage Can outside the saloon, or in the Stardrop Saloon's rotating stock. One Chocolate Cake may be received from opening a Mystery Box.
