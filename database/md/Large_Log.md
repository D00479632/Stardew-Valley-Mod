**Large Logs** are fallen trees found on the Farm. A single large log is found in Cindersap Forest (blocking the entrance to the Secret Woods). Another large log is found blocking a secret passage to the east between the Blacksmith and JojaMart. Large Logs can also be found on floors 41-69 of the Dangerous Mines. A Steel Axe (or better quality) is required to remove a large log, yielding 8 Hardwood (10 with the Forester profession) and 25 Foraging Experience points. Large Logs will never reappear once removed.
