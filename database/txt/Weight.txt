Weight is a statistic that affects how far an enemy will be knocked back when attacked by the player with a weapon.
Each weapon type has a default weight: Daggers have a weight of 5, swords 10, and clubs 15. Some weapons have a weight modifier, which is added to or subtracted from the default weight.[1] Forging a weapon with Amethysts will add +10 per amethyst to the weight.
Amethyst Rings and innate enchantments affect the weight multiplicatively: the multiplier starts out as 1.0. Each Amethyst Ring adds 0.1 to the multiplier, while a "-X Weight" innate enchantment will subtract X/10 from the multiplier. The actual weight value is then the weapon's weight times this multiplier.[2]
This means 2 Amethyst rings increase the amount of knockback by 1.2x, while a maximum-level innate enchantment (-5 Weight) will halve the knockback amount.
