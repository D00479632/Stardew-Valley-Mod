**False Magma Caps** are an enemy found in the Volcano Dungeon.

## Behavior

False Magma Caps disguise themselves as stationary Magma Caps, sometimes surprising the player. Their behavior is similar to Rock Crabs and Lava Crabs. However, they are not invulnerable while immobile.

## Strategy

Although False Magma Caps only move around once the player draws near, they can be differentiated at a distance from normal Magma Caps by moving the cursor over them. If the green "+" symbol () indicating a forageable item does not appear, then it is a False Magma Cap.
