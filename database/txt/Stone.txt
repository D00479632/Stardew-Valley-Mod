Stone is a basic resource obtained by mining rocks with a pickaxe. Stone can also be purchased from Robin at the Carpenter's Shop, or found in Fishing Treasure Chests. Stone Golems and Gray Slimes also drop Stone. Robin sells Stone in her shop at the Desert Festival for 1 Calico Egg. Fifty stones can also be received as a gift from Robin at the Feast of the Winter Star. Stone may also be obtained by digging up an Artifact Spot. A Stonefish Fish Pond may produce 30 Stone when the population reaches 9. Stone can also be acquired by fishing in the fountain left of the Community Center. It can also be gifted by a pet dog with max friendship.
Normal rocks yield between 1 and 3 stones. Boulders yield 10 stones.
Stone is used in various crafting recipes and is also required as a form of payment when purchasing certain buildings and building upgrades at the Carpenter's Shop. The Desert Trader will sell 1 Fiber in exchange for 5 Stone on Tuesdays.
