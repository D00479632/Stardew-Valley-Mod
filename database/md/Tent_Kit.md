The **Tent Kit** is a craftable item that allows the player to construct a tent to sleep in. It can only be used outdoors and is consumed after use. Three Tent Kits are found in a box in the Ginger Island jungle, and one Tent Kit is the first prize obtained from the Trout Derby festival. If a player has already used the Golden Joja Parrot, then Professor Snail will give one Tent Kit as a reward for donating the Mummified Bat to the Island Field Office.

## Usage

The player deploys the Tent Kit outdoors by selecting the lower left corner of a 3x2 area. If there is not enough space, the player attempts to use the Tent Kit indoors (e.g. in a mine), or the next day is a festival, then an error message is shown.\[1] Otherwise, the Tent Kit deploys, and the player can use the tent just like the bed in the farmhouse. Upon using the tent, the game is saved and the player wakes up at 6am the next day in the same location, the tent itself having disappeared. In Multiplayer, multiple people can use the tent at once.

Tent Kits placed outside that are not used will disappear the next day. Tent Kits will not work if there is a festival occurring at the map the next day.
