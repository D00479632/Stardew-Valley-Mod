Treehouse

Address: The Mountain Occupants:

Leo

The **Treehouse** is home to Leo after he moves to the mainland from Ginger Island. It's located on the Mountain, in a large tree east of the entrance of the Railroad and west of Linus' tent.

Before Leo moves to the mainland, it is just a large tree. The night after the player reaches 6 hearts with Leo and he agrees to move to the mainland, a cutscene will show the parrots transforming the tree into Leo's treehouse.
