**Sunflower Seeds** are a type of seed. Mature plants yield Sunflowers and 0-2 Sunflower Seeds.

They can be purchased at Pierre's General Store, at JojaMart, from the Magic Shop Boat at the Night Market on Winter 16 &amp; 17, and occasionally from the Traveling Cart. They can also be obtained by using the Seed Maker or by planting Mixed Flower Seeds. Sunflower Seeds are the only seeds you can buy cheaper at JojaMart than at Pierre's General Store.

## Bug

- When selling Sunflower Seeds to Pierre, seeds collected by harvesting Sunflowers or purchased from Pierre sell for data-sort-value="20"&gt;20g each. However, seeds purchased from JojaMart sell for data-sort-value="100"&gt;100g. Thus, if you purchase one seed from JojaMart, then add collected seeds to that stack in inventory, all the seeds will sell for data-sort-value="100"&gt;100g each.
  
  - If you instead add the purchased seed to the stack of collected seeds (or seeds purchased from Pierre), all the seeds will sell for data-sort-value="20"&gt;20g each.
