Fish Taco is a cooked dish. It is prepared using either the kitchen inside an upgraded farmhouse or a Cookout Kit. It can also be found in Golden Fishing Treasure Chests (7% chance).[1]
It can randomly appear in Krobus' shop on Saturdays for 50g-500g, in the Stardrop Saloon's rotating stock for 1,000g, or at the Traveling Cart for 1,500–2,500g. It can also randomly be found in Garbage Cans outside the saloon. One Fish Taco may be received from opening a Mystery Box. The Statue Of Endless Fortune produces one Fish Taco per year on Caroline's birthday, Winter 7.
