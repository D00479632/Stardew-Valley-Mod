Gunther

The **Museum** can be found in the South-East corner of Pelican Town, south of the Blacksmith.

The museum contains a library and a gallery for displaying the museum's collection. At the start of the game, the entire museum collection is empty. Gunther, the curator, will ask the Player to help by donating Artifacts and Minerals.

Only a single copy of any particular item may be donated. Note that if an item has not yet been donated, its description in inventory or storage says: "Gunther can tell you more about this if you donate it to the museum." Items can be rearranged in the donation interface, or by clicking the small paper on the left side of Gunther's desk at any time. Donated items may be examined by right-clicking on them.

Penny tutors Vincent and Jas in the library on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday.
