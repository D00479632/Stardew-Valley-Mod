### Mossy Tree

Hey just wanted to confirm about the Mossy Tree after you left your comment, the mossy seeds I planted on my farm grew to be this exact tree, I'm not sure if more variants of a mossy tree are available or not (as in the files there are two other variants which both appear during the green rain), but I can send a video of this tree on my farm + my growth screenshots if needed for proof! Please lmk if you plant mossy seeds and they turn out differently, which could be added variations to these special seeds?

Re: Thank you for your message, it's interesting that yours grew differently! I wonder how we would format putting the different trees in then? When I went through the files, there were 3 variants of the green rain mossy trees (green rain trees 1-3) and the regular trees with moss on them were separate images which were labelled tree 1 (oak with moss), tree 2 (maple w/ moss), and tree 3 (pine w/ moss). I can only assume then that pine trees would transform into the swirly all-green fiddlehead fern trees during green rain whereas oak and maple would turn into the two others during the green rain? I got my only mossy seed from the swirly green fern tree (and kept growing them from that one), so maybe that's why all mine look that way! I'll definitely be sure to update the page with this then- it's very exciting.Â :)

Re:re: I'm not sure if it spreads seeds, but it's given me more mossy seeds when I shake it, and when I tapped it, it gave me a fiddlehead fern! (although I've only been through 1 cycle so I'm not sure if it has a chance to give anything else) would you know how to change the title of a section or redirect it to another page...? I'm quite new and unsure of how to redirect mossy tree --&gt; fiddlehead stalk, and we'd have to add the Wild Tree to the tree page as well right...? Thanks!
