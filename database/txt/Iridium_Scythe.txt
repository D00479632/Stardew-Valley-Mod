The Iridium Scythe is a tool that is obtained after claiming Farming Mastery.
The Iridium Scythe has the following benefits:
Can harvest items grown on tilled soil within its swing range, including regular crops, those grown in Garden Pots, Spring Onions, and other forageables grown from Wild Seeds.
Its radius is larger than the Golden Scythe[1] and it is more likely to cut all grass in its radius.
100% chance per swipe to harvest hay from grass, up from 75%.[2]
Inflicts 20 damage, up from 13.[1]
It is the most powerful version of the Scythe. It increases the effectiveness of the Scythe and Golden Scythe by a substantial amount and adds a purple hue.
