Inventory Picture
Glvd (talk) 21:04, 28 May 2024 (UTC) The inventory picture needs to be updated with a new picture and the page needs to talk about the new inventory tabs introduced in 1.6
Just noticed this. I think the new tabs should be on another, new page called "Player Menu" or "Game Menu" or something like that. But yes, the picture on this page does need to be updated at some point. Cheese80 (talk) 17:40, 13 September 2024 (UTC)
I will say this: I created new images (in all 12 languages) no less than THREE TIMES during the initial 1.6 beta. And each time, the menu changed. I will not be updating the images until the final version of v1.6.9 is released. margotbean (talk) 18:53, 13 September 2024 (UTC)
