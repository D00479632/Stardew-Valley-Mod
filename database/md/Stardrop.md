A **Stardrop** is a special item that permanently increases the player's maximum energy by 34 points. The player must immediately consume any Stardrop as soon as it is obtained; it is impossible to add a Stardrop to inventory or save it to eat later.

A maximum of seven Stardrops are available in any game, which together result in 508 maximum energy, nearly doubling the initial value of 270. Finding all Stardrops is necessary to achieve Perfection.

Consuming a Stardrop will restore all of the player's energy as well as increase maximum energy, regardless of how low the energy was before consuming it. No health is restored when consuming a stardrop.

## Trivia

- Stardrops used to be called "Cosmic Fruit" in early versions of the game. (forum post)
- Willy mentions a Stardrop in his story at the Feast of the Winter Star. He says that some people claim the Stardrop is somehow connected to the Winter Star that is only visible from Stardew Valley.
- After achieving Perfection, a stone carving of a Stardrop will appear above Grandpa's Shrine.
- Prior to version 1.3.27 a Stardrop could be taken into inventory and then placed in a Chest, gifted (as a universally hated gift), used in the Grange Display at the Stardew Valley Fair, or sold in the shipping bin for data-sort-value="7777"&gt;7,777g. As of v1.3.27, a stardrop obtained using the item ID glitch can still be sold in the shipping bin or gifted as a universally hated gift in PC or mobile versions of the game.
- The Stardrop was added to the game Terraria with ConcernedApe's permission in October 2022.
