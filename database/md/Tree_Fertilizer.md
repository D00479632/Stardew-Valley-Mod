**Tree Fertilizer** is a Fertilizer that speeds the growth of any wild trees. It must be sprinkled on a tree seed or sapling that has already been planted, not on an unplanted tile. It does not speed up growth of Fruit Trees or Tea Bushes. It can be crafted at Foraging level 7.

Seeds/saplings already sprinkled with Tree Fertilizer take on a red hue until fully grown. Most fertilized trees advance one stage of growth each night until stage 4, reaching the final stage of growth after two nights. The exceptions are the Mahogany Tree, which has only a 60% chance to advance to the next stage each night if fertilized, and the Mystic Tree, which only has a 30% chance each night when fertilized.

Fertilized seeds and seedlings grow even in Winter. Unfertilized trees do not grow at all in winter.
