## Behavior

All types of ingredients in any quantity can be processed at the same time. All products are ready the next morning.

The milled goods will be ready the morning after the produce is placed in the mill, and they can be found in the little box on the right side of the mill. It acts like a chest (with 36 storage slots), accumulating milled goods until they are retrieved. You can leave current contents there while you process more produce, and the results are added in the next day. The box also signals that it has milled goods in the first slot, like a piece of manufacturing equipment.

You can put additional items into this box and use it as you do any chest, as long as there are at least 2 different types of items in it. When doing so, however, care must be taken that the box has room for the mill to place its milled goods. These goods are accumulated in slots that already contain milled goods, or if those don't exist, then in the first available open slot(s). **If there are not enough available slots overnight, milled goods are lost**. If you mill two stacks and only one slot is available, the first stack you place in the mill is saved in that slot, and the other is lost.

### Tips

- The box does not signal the presence of any milled goods that are not in the first slot.
