**Ginger Ale** is a cooked drink. It is prepared using either the kitchen inside an upgraded farmhouse or a Cookout Kit.

When consumed, it grants the player +1 luck for 5m. As a drink, its buff stacks with any food buffs (including Speed), but replaces any other drink buffs (*i.e.,* from Coffee or Green Tea).
