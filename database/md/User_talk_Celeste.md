## Cache

What is the concern you're seeing with the wrong IP address showing up? What issue do you feel is there with the cache? -- Prod (talk) 01:26, 17 March 2021 (UTC)

The thing is, it shows a completely wrong IP address belonging to CloudFlare, preventing any valid IP checks. Basically, the IP address returned on certain occasions, such as editing whilst logged out or when receiving the email confirmation email, is a Cloudflare IP and not one's own IP. MediaWiki's website provides instructions on CloudFlare configuration. Remedying that would have some benefits, notably, from a user perspective, being able to confirm whether an account created belongs to oneself or no (the IP address of an account creation is sent to the user in the email confirmation email), and from an administrative perspective, being able to block IP addresses belonging to vandals whilst not disrupting user access for other users. It isn't an absolute necessity since this wiki does not use mw:Extension:CheckUser, but fixing the cache, configuring it for Cloudflare (which takes like 5 minutes when I first did so myself) would still be a highly beneficial improvement. -- Celeste (talk) 14:20, 17 March 2021 (UTC)

Thanks for pointing out the issue, it should be fixed now. -- Prod (talk) 04:30, 18 March 2021 (UTC)

Great. Wishing you the best! Celeste (talk) 00:10, 29 March 2021 (UTC)

Godspeed. Celeste (talk) 00:20, 29 March 2021 (UTC)

But can you? JJPMaster (talk) 00:21, 29 March 2021 (UTC)

I can't. Haven't mastered those ultradashes yet. Celeste (talk) 00:25, 29 March 2021 (UTC)

But do you know anyone to force ask to install mw:Extension:RenameUser? JJPMaster (talk) 00:29, 29 March 2021 (UTC)

I could try asking Prod, but since that user doesn't have a talkpage I don't think it would be nice to do so. (My alternate reality self is *much* more polite than my (bleep) self.) That's why I asked Margotbean, who is the most active admin here. Celeste (talk) 00:32, 29 March 2021 (UTC)

Which universe is more polite exactly? JJPMaster (talk) 00:40, 29 March 2021 (UTC)

Eh, it varies. The Celeste universe is quite polite; Stardew Valley's, basically equally so (but in a different way). The (bleep) universe is better than Wikipedia's, but is just about tied with RW's. The iPod wiki's universe, on the other hand... nah. Celeste (talk) 00:41, 29 March 2021 (UTC)

There's an iPod wiki? JJPMaster (talk) 00:45, 29 March 2021 (UTC)
