The **Geode** is a Mineral deposit that contains minerals, artifacts, ores, or basic resources. It can be obtained from breaking rocks above ground in Stardew Valley and in the Mines (especially floors 1-39), or dropped by Duggies. It may also be found in Fishing Treasure Chests, in the Garbage Can outside the Museum or received as a gift at the Feast of the Winter Star. A Stonefish Fish Pond may produce 1 or 5 Geodes when its population reaches 9. Geodes can also be obtained by pickaxing Geode Nodes. 2-4 Geodes may occasionally be found in Supply Crates on the Beach Farm if the player has not upgraded the Farmhouse yet. Geodes cannot be obtained from breaking rocks on Spring 1 of Year 1.\[1]

The geode can be broken open by Clint in the Blacksmith shop for data-sort-value="25"&gt;25g or by using a Geode Crusher.

Neither daily luck nor luck buffs affect the contents of a Geode.

### Resources

Note that obtaining Iron Ore from a Geode is only possible after reaching level 26 of The Mines. Before reaching level 26, a geode that would give iron ore will instead give copper ore. Except for clay and stone, the following items will be obtained in the following amounts: 30% for 1, 30% for 3, 30% for 5, 9% for 10, and 1% for 20. Stone has a 50% chance to use those values and a 50% chance to give only 1. Only 1 clay can be obtained from a single geode.

- Eight Geodes may be requested by the Raccoon at the Giant Stump as part of his fifth request, or as part of any request starting with the sixth.

## Trivia

- By multiplying the sell price of each item by the chance to obtain it and how many you would receive on average (with ores, clay, and stone) and adding those products together, you can find the average profit of breaking open a single geode. Geodes have an average return of data-sort-value="59.94"&gt;59.94g. With the Gemologist Profession, geodes have an average return of data-sort-value="73.58"&gt;73.58g. The geode will sell in the shipping bin for data-sort-value="50"&gt;50g. It is profitable to process geodes through Geode Crusher and sell the contents.
