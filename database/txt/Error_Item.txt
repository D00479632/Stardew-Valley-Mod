Error Item
???
Information
Season  All
Sell Price 0g
An Error Item is any item whose internal ID doesn't exist in the game's item data. Error items have no associated item data and thus default to purchase/sell prices of 0g, descriptions reading "???", and a placeholder ðŸ›‡ sprite.
There are no known ways to produce an Error Item in the latest versions of the base game. However, they can occur due to mods.

Trivia
Version 1.0 of the game did not allow the player to enter brackets [ ], so generating Error Items was not possible.
History
1.2.26: You can no longer find an Error Item with a bread sprite in The Saloon's shop and the garbage can outside the Saloon.
1.5: The item spawn cheat now ignores invalid item IDs, instead of producing Error Items.
1.6: Error items now display a placeholder ðŸ›‡ sprite, instead of whatever sprite matches their index position in the spritesheet. They also no longer cause crashes when interacting with them in some case.
