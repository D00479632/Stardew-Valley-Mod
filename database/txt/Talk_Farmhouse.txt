Farmhouse Tier 2 and 3 Image Sizes
They're several hundred pixels smaller than the image for Farmhouse Tier 1? Is this a problem? If so, we should probably get new images. Blushock (talk) 15:13, 17 January 2023 (UTC)
I think they're fine the way they are. margotbean (talk) 19:47, 17 January 2023 (UTC)
Please help me for add bugs in categories
I found a bug in Farmhouse but there is no bug in the categories here that I can add. How is it added? Alyasinsalehi7 (talk) 17:36, 17 June 2023 (UTC)
You need to report bugs on the official forums first; there are separate threads for mobile bugs, translation errors, and unmodded games. After that, you create a section called "Bugs" on the page, and describe the bug. That's it! margotbean (talk) 18:19, 17 June 2023 (UTC)
Processing machine layout
As explained by the shed page, the upgraded farmhouse/cabin can provide places for processing machines. Would it be okay to add some images for the layouts in different upgrades? Stardude (talk) 00:00, 22 June 2023 (UTC)
They're already on the Keg page. margotbean (talk) 00:57, 22 June 2023 (UTC)
That seems a bit impractical, so maybe we should have a reference in it or have the images there as well. Stardude (talk) 01:03, 22 June 2023 (UTC)
It would make more sense to place a link on the Cabin page. margotbean (talk) 17:51, 22 June 2023 (UTC)
Furniture Placement Map
Are there maps for available furniture placements inside the farmhouse in various upgrade stages, and if so, could they be added or linked here? Not all furniture placement restrictions are intuitive, so it would be nice to know for planning purposes, particularly for people who have yet to purchase the furniture catalogue for access to 0g furniture prices.
Example of non-intuitive furniture placement restriction: While I can put a small painting (1x1) on any of the 8 non-corner wall panels in the kitchen, I cannot instead put wall sconces on 5 of these 8 wall panels. In the fully upgraded farmhouse, the only places I can put wall sconces in the kitchen are these 3 spaces in the left cornerâ€”a restraint I wasn't aware of prior to buying multiple wall sconces for the kitchen: [images removed by admin]

There are no maps, because there are no such restrictions on PC. This appears to be a mobile bug, which you should report on the official forums. The developers don't monitor the wiki for bug reports, but they do monitor the forums. I'm sorry you appear to have wasted some gold on wall sconces you can't use where you wanted them! But since this is a bug issue, I'm going to delete the images pending a resolution on the forums. Good luck! margotbean (talk) 18:47, 24 October 2023 (UTC)
New Renovations
I'm not sure how to fromat the new renovations with their costs and everything. I have prices for some of them if anyone does know: expanded corner room- 100,000; attic- 60,000; cubby-10,000; dining room- 150,000; open bedroom- 10,000
Kalenthi (talk) 21:10, 20 March 2024 (UTC)
Use the template called "price". You surround the word "price" with double curly brackets, { and }. After price, continue with a vertical bar and the number of gold required, without commas. So, inside the double brackets: "price|100000". What you see is: 100,000g Giles (talk) 06:22, 21 March 2024 (UTC)
I'm not sure how the renovations would fit with the current table. Should we make a new section/table for them? Kalenthi (talk) 20:12, 21 March 2024 (UTC)
My first thought would be to remove renovations from the upgrade table entirely, and create a new renovations table. Information can be taken from the existing upgrade table and incorporated. Then separate rows would contain the individual renovation types (which I doubt are considered upgrades, and are optional anyway). The price info you have would then be incorporated in the new table. What do you think? Margotbean is beyond busy to give a buy-in, but giving this kind of thing a try is just what everyone is doing right now, in the wake of all the v1.6 changes. It can always be revised or withdrawn, if necessary. Giles (talk) 04:17, 22 March 2024 (UTC)
Yeah that's what I was thinking. I just didn't want to make a big change like that without discussing it first. Thanks!
Kalenthi (talk) 18:30, 22 March 2024 (UTC)
Changing to a new table is fine. Giles is right, I am swamped, but this change sounds like the best thing for 1.6 changes. Thanks all! margotbean (talk) 19:56, 22 March 2024 (UTC)
Farmhouse Size is Incorrect
After investigating in game, it appears the exact farmhouse dimensions are actually 5x9. The wiki states it is 6x9 which is incorrect. Can this be updated? Dilly the Wizard (talk) 13:55, 3 April 2024 (UTC)
upgrade 2
to upgrade your house a second time (to add nurseries) you need 150 hardwood, not 100 Csh1vr (talk) 22:21, 20 May 2024 (UTC)
Thank you for demonstrating why the page is protected right now. margotbean (talk) 22:43, 20 May 2024 (UTC)
Transclude House Renovation section from Carpenter's Shop
These two pages are talking about the same thing in the same detail, so I find it sensical to transclude one page from another. The only problem is these pages use different sets of images and I have no idea which set to keep (or both). How should we go with this? IBugOne (talk) 16:19, 29 June 2024 (UTC)
The change you're proposing would require many many <noinclude> tags... margotbean (talk) 17:08, 29 June 2024 (UTC)
Huh, why? Wouldn't the syntax of {{#lst:PageName|section_name}} suffice? IBugOne (talk) 18:12, 29 June 2024 (UTC)
Farmhouse includes too much information for the Carpenter's Shop page, and Carpenter's Shop doesn't have enough info. for the Farmhouse page. So, if we were to transclude from Farmhouse, we would need to noinclude an entire column and some of the column titles for it to make sense. margotbean (talk) 16:28, 30 June 2024 (UTC)
Suggestion
Add a link to the Island Farmhouse. --Unsigned post by Insanity Studios 19:27, 7 October 2024
