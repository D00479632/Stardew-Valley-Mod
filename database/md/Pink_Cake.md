The Queen of Sauce 21 Summer, Year 2

Ingredients Melon (1) Wheat Flour (1) Sugar (1) Egg (1)

**Pink Cake** is a cooked dish. It is prepared using either the kitchen inside an upgraded farmhouse or a Cookout Kit. It can also be received as a gift at the Feast of the Winter Star or may randomly appear in Krobus' shop on Saturdays or in the Stardrop Saloon's rotating stock. It can also randomly be found in the Garbage Can outside the saloon. Five Pink Cakes can be purchased from Haley's shop at the Desert Festival for data-sort-value="20"&gt; 20 Calico Eggs. One Pink Cake may be received from opening a Mystery Box. If the player's character is male, after he earns data-sort-value="120000"&gt;120,000g he will receive a letter from mom with a Pink Cake enclosed.

3 Pink Cakes are the reward for completing the Chef's Bundle on the Bulletin Board. Pink cake is also sometimes contained within Big Slimes (0.1% chance). Killing the big slime will result in a receiving a Pink Cake, or two if the player has a Burglar's Ring equipped.

The Statue Of Endless Fortune produces three Pink Cakes per year, on the birthdays of Haley, Jas, and Vincent.

**Note**: this recipe is profitable - it will always result in profit if using the lowest quality ingredients as well as Wheat Flour and Sugar from the Mill.
