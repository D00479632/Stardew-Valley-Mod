Armored Bugs (dangerous) are an enemy found in the Skull Cavern during the Skull Cavern Invasion quest. They are invincible except when attacked by a weapon with the Bug Killer enchantment. 80 cave insects (any type) need to be killed for the Monster Eradication Goal at the Adventurer's Guild.

Behavior
They behave identical to their weaker counterpart the Armored Bug. They fly back and forth in a vertical straight line between walls or objects. They are not aggressive, but will deal damage to the player if touched from the front.
Strategy
They can only be killed with the Bug Killer enchant, and should be left alone otherwise. Clearing obstacles in their flight path, such as stones, can give them more room to move which also gives the player more time to avoid them.
Bugs
If the player stands close to a wall or another impassable object while colliding with the Armored Bug, it will permanently freeze in its place.
History
1.5: Introduced.
1.6: Changed Monster Eradication Goal for cave insects from 125 to 80.
