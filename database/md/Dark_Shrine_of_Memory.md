From Stardew Valley Wiki

The **Dark Shrine of Memory** is an altar found in the Witch's Hut. It can be accessed after completing the Goblin Problem quest. The player can offer data-sort-value="30000"&gt;30,000g to erase all divorced spouses' memories, making it seem like they had never been married. It also erases Krobus' memory if he is an ex-roommate. This effect takes place immediately after using the shrine.

Talking to the divorced spouses right after wiping their memories will result in this dialogue:

“ “You're the new farmer, aren't you? You seem... no. I'm sure we've never met.”

Erasing an NPC's memory will not allow the player to see any previously seen Heart Events again.
