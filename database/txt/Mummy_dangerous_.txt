Mummies (dangerous) are an enemy found in the Skull Cavern during the Skull Cavern Invasion quest. 100 Mummies (any type) need to be killed for the Monster Eradication Goal at the Adventurer's Guild.
Behavior
They behave identical to their weaker counterpart the Mummy with the only differences being higher health and more damage. Indentically to the regular Mummy, after being knocked down they will get back up after 10 seconds unless killed by an explosion while downed. They will tremble slightly right before getting back up. Downed Mummies are temporarily immobilized and cannot be walked through, but do not deal contact damage. In this form, they are immune to all types of damage except for explosions, which will deal 999 fixed damage.
Strategy
Simply hit them until they fall into a pile of bandages, then use a bomb to kill them. Other explosive items work as well, such as Cherry Bombs and Explosive Ammo. To maximize efficiency, try to lure multiple Mummies into one area, preferably one with dense clusters of rocks, and bomb them all at once.
Alternatively, players can avoid using any explosives to kill Mummies if they upgrade a weapon with the Crusader enchantment.
Wearing a Napalm Ring will not automatically kill Mummies after knocking them down, and the explosions triggered by killing nearby Serpents and Carbon Ghosts are too small to be reliable, so manual bombing is usually required.
