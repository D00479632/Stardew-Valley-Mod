The **Coconut** is an inedible Foraged Fruit found in the Calico Desert and by shaking palm trees on Ginger Island. It can also be bought at the Oasis on Mondays for data-sort-value="200"&gt;200g or may randomly appear in the Traveling Cart's stock for data-sort-value="100"300–1,000g. It can also randomly be found in Garbage Cans after unlocking The Desert. Sandy may also send one in the mail as a gift. The Statue Of Endless Fortune produces one Coconut per year on Linus' birthday, Winter 3.

Although it is inedible, it may be put in a Preserves Jar to make Coconut Jelly, or in a Keg to make Coconut Wine. Coconuts cannot be planted to create Palm Trees.

The Island Trader will trade 1 Golden Coconut for 10 Coconuts, provided the player already previously found at least one Golden Coconut.
