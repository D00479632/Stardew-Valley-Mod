Behavior
Skeletons will approach and attack the player by collision. They also have a longer-ranged bone throw attack, which passes through rocks. This ranged attack is interrupted if the skeleton takes damage.
Strategy
Simply hit them as soon as possible to prevent them from throwing bones. If they do throw bones, either dodge them or swing at them with a weapon, as they can be destroyed with any weapon that deals damage.
Trivia
During the Spirit's Eve event, the player can find two caged skeletons in the middle of the town where some villagers view them.
History
1.0: Introduced.
