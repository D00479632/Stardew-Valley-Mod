Hi Peaw,I\`m 骑凤散人 a.k.a Punkzhang from Chinese version wiki.I\`m completing the HISTORY part of all entries these days,would it help your work if I add the missing Turkish link(ofcouse include other language links) at the same time?I saw you adding links in Chinese version wiki sometimes.Lots of 1.6 new items only have 3 languages version so far,that\`s the reason why I ask you.Have a nice day!骑凤散人 (talk) 03:32, 2 July 2024 (UTC)

## Translation into Arabic

Hello dear I am one of the Stardo Valley players and fans Unfortunately, there is no support for Arabic, neither on the game nor even on Wiki That's why I decided to translate wiki pages into Arabic My question is, is that possible? And if yes, how, please Monster korona (talk) 04:36, 7 July 2024 (UTC)

Hello, I'm not the person you should ask this. I'm just an editor like everyone else here. Wiki only supports languages that the game supports. Peaw (talk) 08:56, 7 July 2024 (UTC)

## about Seed Spot‎

Hello Peaw! Just let you know, I undo your change of Seed Spot on Chinese wiki. The change will make dates wrong grammar and not official. It\`s very different between English and Chinese. Hope you can understand.Have a nice day!骑凤散人 (talk) 08:54, 26 October 2024 (UTC)

Hello, that's no problem. I didn't know it's different in Chinese. Have a nice day! Peaw (talk) 09:15, 26 October 2024 (UTC)
