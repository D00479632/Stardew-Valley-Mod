Golden Tag Turn this in to the Trout Derby booth for a reward. Information Source Rainbow Trout Sell Price data-sort-value="0"&gt;0g

The **Golden Tag** is a special item that can be obtained by catching a Rainbow Trout during the Trout Derby festival. It can be exchanged for prizes at the derby booth.

During the festival, each Rainbow Trout catch caught anywhere (with the exception of from a Fish Pond) has a 33% chance to give the player a Golden Tag. This chance is multiplied by the number of Rainbow Trout caught, so it increases to 66% if 2 Rainbow Trout are caught at once and to 99% if 3 are caught at once.\[1] Only 1 Golden Tag can be caught per catch even if the player caught multiple Rainbow Trout at once. When a Golden Tag is obtained, if the player did not get a Fishing Treasure Chest it will be caught with the fish itself. Otherwise it will be obtained with the treasure chest that appears while catching the Rainbow Trout.

Golden Tags carry over from day to day and can be saved for subsequent festivals.
