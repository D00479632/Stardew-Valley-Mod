Below is a list of all Shop Schedules, including when they are open or closed.
Note: All buildings and homes in Stardew Valley are "locked" on all festival days where the festival begins before 7pm (i.e., all festivals other than Spirit's Eve and Dance of the Moonlight Jellies). The Sewers, Community Center, Movie Theater, and the Spa will remain open. Shops and homes remain locked all day, even if the player does not attend the festival.
The Night Market festival is unique, in that no homes or shops are locked during festival days (Winter 15-17).
Obtaining the Key To The Town expands access to shops, but (despite its description) it has some restrictions.
