## Tailoring

Periwinkle can be used in the spool of the Sewing Machine to create the Rain Coat. It can be used in dyeing, serving as a blue dye at the dye pots, located in Emily's and Haley's house, 2 Willow Lane.

## Fish Pond

Periwinkles can be placed in a Fish Pond, where they will reproduce every day. The initial pond capacity is 3 fish, but the capacity can be increased to 10 by completing three quests. Typical output includes light blue Periwinkle Roe, Green Algae, and various Trash items, but more valuable items are possible starting at population 5.

## Quests

- One Periwinkle may be requested by several fish in Fish Pond quests.
- Five Periwinkle may be requested by The Raccoon as part of the first request or as part of the sixth request and beyond.

## Note

Periwinkle will never sell for more than data-sort-value="37"&gt;37g under any circumstances, making it more profitable to turn them into Sashimi (worth data-sort-value="75"&gt;75g) before selling them.
