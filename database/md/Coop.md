The **Coop** is a type of farm building purchasable and upgradable from Robin at the Carpenter's Shop.

## Construction

The Coop takes three days to construct. During this time, Robin is unreachable for dialogue or gifting.

Upgrading the Coop requires two days. During this time, the coop can be used as normal. Robin can be found inside the Coop for purposes such as dialogue or gifting.

The total cost of a Deluxe Coop, built from scratch, is data-sort-value="34000"&gt;34,000g, Wood (1200) and Stone (450) (Or, if all wood and stone are bought from Robin during Year 1, data-sort-value="55000"&gt;55,000g, and data-sort-value="139000"&gt;139,000g if bought in Year 2+.)

If the player chooses the Meadowlands Farm Map, there will be a coop built on their farm to start.

## Features

The coop can house chickens, ducks, rabbits, and dinosaurs. Once you have unlocked an animal by building the coop needed to house it, that animal can be placed in any other non-upgraded coops you have built as well.

The Deluxe Coop features an Autofeed System; hay from your silos will be automatically distributed. (You can still let the animals feed on grass outside, and the hay will not be eaten.)

Coop Animals may be stuck outside at night if the coop doors are closed. The conditions for this are not clear (see Animals trapped outside). If an animal is stuck outside the coop at night, the next day their mood will be "grumpy". Animals stuck outside are also subject to Wild Animal Attacks.

The Coop can also be used in a manner similar to the Shed for storing Chests, Artisan Equipment, Furniture, etc. The animals are undisturbed by the clutter, even if their paths are blocked. However, excessive obstructions may prevent the spawning of coop animal products.
