Slime Egg-Press Compresses 100 pieces of slime into a slime egg. It's a miracle of science! Information Source Crafting • Bookseller Sell Price *Cannot be sold* Crafting Recipe Source Combat (Level 6) Ingredients Coal (25) Fire Quartz (1) Battery Pack (1)

The **Slime Egg-Press** is a piece of equipment used to create Slime Eggs from Slime. The crafting recipe is unlocked after reaching Combat Level 6. The Bookseller may trade 1 Slime Egg-Press for 2 Monster Compendiums each, provided the player has already earned the power from that book.

The Slime Egg-Press can be started by adding 100 Slime from the toolbar, and it creates 1 Green, Blue, Red, or Purple Slime Egg after 1,200m (20h).\[1] It cannot produce Tiger Slime Eggs. Slime Eggs can then be used to hatch new slimes in the Slime Hutch or elsewhere, or they can be sold for profit.

The color of the egg is random, and the slime's gender can only be determined after hatching from a Slime Incubator. The color of the slime(s) from which pieces of slime were obtained does not affect the color of the resulting egg.

The chances for the press to generate a particular egg are:\[2]

- **64.125%** Green Slime Egg
- **21.375%** Blue Slime Egg
- **9.5%** Red Slime Egg
- **5%** Purple Slime Egg
