The **Super Cucumber** is a fish that can be caught in the ocean at The Beach or on the Beach Farm during Summer and Fall evenings, and on Ginger Island South, Southeast, West (ocean), and the Pirate Cove during any season. It can also randomly be found in Garbage Cans during Summer and Fall, or at the Traveling Cart for data-sort-value="250"750–1,250g. There is a 4% chance to catch a Super Cucumber during the deep-sea submarine ride at the Night Market during Winter 15-17 (7% if using a Curiosity Lure). The Statue Of Endless Fortune produces one Super Cucumber per year on the Wizard's birthday, Winter 17.

Super Cucumber can be caught regardless of time of day or season using Magic Bait.

## Tailoring

Super Cucumber is used in the spool of the Sewing Machine with Cloth in the feed to create a dyeable Tube Top. It is a purple dye when used in the spool of the Sewing Machine with a dyeable clothing item in the feed. It can be placed in the purple dye pot at Emily's and Haley's house for use in dyeing.

## Fish Pond

Super Cucumbers can be placed in a Fish Pond, where they will reproduce every 5 days. The initial pond capacity is 3 fish, but the capacity can be increased to 10 by completing three quests. When the population of the pond reaches 3, the color of the water changes to purple. The primary output is purple Super Cucumber Roe, but more valuable items are possible starting at population 9.
