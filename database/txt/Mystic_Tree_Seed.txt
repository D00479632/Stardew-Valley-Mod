The Mystic Tree Seed is a tree seed that grows into a Mystic Tree. It can be crafted after claiming Foraging Mastery.
Note that Mystic Tree Seeds can only be obtained by crafting. They cannot be obtained from chopping or shaking Mystic Trees. Also, Mystic Trees do not spread seeds when fully grown.[1]
Unlike other fertilized tree seeds that have a 100% chance of growing to the next stage overnight, Mystic Tree Seeds fertilized with Tree Fertilizer have a 30% chance of growing to the next stage each night, including during Winter. Unfertilized seeds have a 15% chance of growing to the next stage each night during Spring, Summer, or Fall.[1]
