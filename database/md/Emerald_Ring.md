The **Emerald Ring** is a ring that can be purchased from the Adventurer's Guild for data-sort-value="5000"&gt;5,000g after reaching level 80 in The Mines. It can also be found in Fishing Treasure Chests after reaching Fishing level 2. It can also be found in Mystery Boxes and Golden Mystery Boxes.

The Emerald Ring increases Weapon Speed by 10%. This effect is applied after any Weapon Speed buff effects.\[1]

Because the effect is a percent multiplier, it works differently than the Weapon Speed buff. A sword or dagger with +0 Weapon Speed would effectively have +1 Weapon Speed while wearing the ring (40 milliseconds faster), whereas a club with +0 Weapon Speed would be closer to +2 with the ring (72 milliseconds faster).

Equipping a second Emerald Ring adds a further 10% weapon speed, for a total 20% increase.\[2]
