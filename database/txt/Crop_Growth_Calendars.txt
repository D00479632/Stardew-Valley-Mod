This page lists crop growth tables for all crops. The "Base" table shows growth without the Agriculturist profession and without any growth fertilizer. Below each Base table, comparisons between growth fertilizers and the Agriculturist Profession are shown. Note that the increase in growth is 10% with Speed-Gro or the Agriculturist Profession, so the "10%" table applies to each.
With the exception of multi-harvest crops, the tables assume that seeds are replanted and watered on the day of harvest.
