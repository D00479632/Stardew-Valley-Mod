**Rhubarb Pie** is a cooked dish. It is prepared using either the kitchen inside an upgraded farmhouse or a Cookout Kit.

**Note:** this recipe is profitable - it will result in profit when using the lowest quality rhubarb as well as wheat flour and sugar from the Mill.

Rhubarb Pie may randomly appear in Krobus' shop on Saturdays, in the Garbage Can outside the saloon, or in the Stardrop Saloon's rotating stock. One Rhubarb Pie may be received from opening a Mystery Box.
