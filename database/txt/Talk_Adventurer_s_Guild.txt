Monster Eradication Goal for Bugs
Are we sure of the new reduction to 80 for cave insects? MouseyPounds has updated his Stardew Checkup helper for v1.6, and no change was made for this goal there. Not sure how he picks up the goal amounts, but he's pretty reliable, so maybe it's worth another check? Giles (talk) 03:36, 1 April 2024 (UTC)
Hey! I just checked in Content\Data\MonsterSlayerQuests.xnb. The "Count" for "Insects" is 80, so I believe that reduction is correct unless there's a bug somewhere else in the code. Bluestblur (talk) 04:11, 1 April 2024 (UTC)
Thanks! I guess MouseyPounds could use a bug report. I'm not in a position to do it myself. Giles (talk) 04:15, 1 April 2024 (UTC)
MouseyPounds fixed that bug between my last comment and now. Giles (talk) 17:47, 24 April 2024 (UTC)
