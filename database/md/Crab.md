Crabs can be placed in a Fish Pond, where they will reproduce every 3 days. The initial pond capacity is 3 fish, but the capacity can be increased to 10 by completing three quests. Typical output includes red Crab Roe, Seaweed, and various Trash items, but more valuable items are possible starting at population 5.
