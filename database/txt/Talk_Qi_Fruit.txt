Wine and Jelly
Ok, the fruit expires when the quest expires, even when it's in equipment. But if you succeed in producing wine or jelly from it, and gather that from the keg or jar, does that wine or jelly also expire when the quest expires? After all, they are neither seed nor fruit.

The code seems to specify specifically items 889 and 890 (Qi Fruit & Qi Beans). So, I think wine/jelly would stick around. Although I've completed the special order in-game, I've never jammed or kegged the fruit. margotbean (talk) 18:16, 14 October 2021 (UTC)
Thanks. And I've been pondering just why anyone would make Qi jam or wine. There's no profit motive, for sure. I may try it just to see if it's really possible. I think maybe no one has. And I wonder if the ability to make Qi jam or wine is itself a development oversight. Could it be a bug? Strange. Giles (talk) 00:13, 23 October 2021 (UTC)
I have made both Qi Fruit Wine and Qi Fruit Jelly. It does not disappear when the quest ends. If you have some in process when the quest ends, the Wine or Jelly will still be produced. Zendowolf (talk) 05:08, 23 October 2021 (UTC)
Thanks! Giles (talk) 06:07, 30 October 2021 (UTC)
Qi wine and jam seems to have Wine and Jam properties. For instance I tried to gift Qi wine to Leah and Harvey, they both loved it. So it could be used that way if you grow too much Qi Fruits, so the supernumerary ones have a use instead of disappearing. -- Charly (talk) 10:22, 30 October 2021 (UTC)
Thanks again! I was thinking of trying that one out too if the situation arose. I like the idea. Maybe I'll make a point of doing it. Giles (talk) 15:54, 30 October 2021 (UTC)
Qi Fruit in Seed Maker?
Hey all! Iâ€™m wondering if this has happened for anyone else or if Iâ€™m crazy ðŸ˜‚ Put probably 300-400 Qi Fruit through my seed makers, and I got out an ancient seed! Not that game breaking, since by the time you get to Qiâ€™s Crops, you probably have a greenhouse full of Ancient Fruit. Just thought it was cool and wanted to confirm ðŸ˜ŠðŸ‘Œ DKSN (talk) 16:29, 2 July 2024 (UTC)
You can get Ancient Seeds from putting in anything in the Seed Maker (0.5% chance), as it says on the Seed Maker page. User314159 (talk) 17:12, 2 July 2024 (UTC)
