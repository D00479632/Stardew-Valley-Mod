## Trivia

- The solar panel counts sunny days based on the location it is placed. Thus, a solar panel placed down on Ginger Island will not be affected by rain in Stardew Valley, and vice versa.
  
  - Arguably the best location to place solar panels is the Calico Desert due to the desert having its own weather (always sunny).
