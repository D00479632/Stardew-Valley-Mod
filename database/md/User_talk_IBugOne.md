## Code Refererences

Hello IBugOne - I have a request: could you please get in the habit of adding code references to pages, especially when the existing information is significantly changed?

For example, it was possible for Quarry Mine floors (in the mines) to be infested in v1.4 of the game, and the change notes for v1.5 don't specifically list the change to make that impossible.

I also don't see where the Gatherer profession affects Snow Yams or Winter Roots (only the generous enchantment). So, a code reference would really help!

Thanks very much, margotbean (talk) 18:28, 26 July 2022 (UTC)

A clarification specifically for Snow Yams and Winter Roots: The reference to Gatherer is added to the sentence of "when grown from Winter Seeds", in which case they behave like standard forage items. This is the only way they're affected by the Gatherer profession (and exactly how with the Botanist profession).

In other cases, I try my best to leave useful tips in the edit summary so that people know I'm not adding nonsense. I'm not yet familiar with the reference format. I'll try to add references when I can and find it convenient. - IBugOne (talk) 19:20, 26 July 2022 (UTC)

That would make it convenient for me not to have to chase down the code reference or revert the edit! The reference format may seem daunting, but you can see the format in use on multiple pages (The Mines might be a good example).

I'm sorry about the Snow Yams/Winter Roots; I can read, I apparently just didn't choose to. Sincere apologies! Thanks, margotbean (talk) 19:45, 26 July 2022 (UTC)
