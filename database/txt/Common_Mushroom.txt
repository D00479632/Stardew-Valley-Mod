Tailoring
Common Mushroom is used in the spool of the Sewing Machine to create a Shirt. It can be used in dyeing, serving as an orange dye at the dye pots, located in Emily's and Haley's house, 2 Willow Lane.
This shirt is very likely a reference to the Super Mario game series, where the titular character Mario commonly eats mushrooms.
Quests
The Common Mushroom may be randomly requested in Fall at the "Help Wanted" board outside Pierre's General Store for a reward of 120g and 150 Friendship points.
2-3 Common Mushrooms may be requested by Bullhead, Largemouth Bass, or Woodskip in Fish Pond quests.
Trivia
Common Mushrooms are the only fall forageable that can be directly put into the Seed Maker.
