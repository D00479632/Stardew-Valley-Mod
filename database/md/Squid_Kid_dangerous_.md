## Behavior

They behave identical to their weaker counterpart, the Squid Kid. They will move suddenly, hover over rocks, and shoot 4 fireballs at the player, which ricochet off walls.

## Strategy

Simply move in quickly and hit them. A Slingshot can be used to safely kill them from a distance. Their fireballs can also be hit and destroyed; however, fireballs will *not* be stopped by a sword's secondary attack.
