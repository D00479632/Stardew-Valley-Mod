The **Spinner** is a tackle that helps fishing by reducing maximum delay before a nibble by 3.75 seconds (7.5 seconds if the player is using an Advanced Iridium Rod with 2 Spinners). It can be crafted or purchased from Willy's Fish Shop for data-sort-value="500"&gt;500g after reaching Fishing level 6. It may also randomly appear at the Traveling Cart for data-sort-value="250"750–1,250g.

Only the Iridium Rod or the Advanced Iridium Rod can equip tackle. The Iridium Rod can only attach one tackle at a time, while the Advanced Iridium Rod can attach two. To attach tackle, left-click on the tackle, then right-click on the rod. To remove tackle, first right-click to remove any bait, then right-click to remove the tackle. For an Advanced Iridium Rod, the left tackle will be the first one removed.

Tackle does not stack in inventory or chests; each tackle takes up one inventory slot.
