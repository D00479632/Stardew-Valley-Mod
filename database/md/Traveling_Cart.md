Traveling Cart

Open Hours: 6:00am to 8:00pm Friday and Sunday  
5:00pm to 2:00am during Night Market  
12:00pm to 2:00am during Desert Festival Closed: Monday - Thursday, Saturday Address: Cindersap Forest Occupants: Traveling Merchant

The **Traveling Cart** is a shop that appears south of The Farm in Cindersap Forest on Fridays and Sundays, closing at 8pm. It also appears each day of the Night Market (Winter 15-17) and each day of the Desert Festival (Spring 15-17). Stock changes each day the Traveling Merchant appears. The merchant will sell a selection of ten random items in limited quantities (1 or 5 of each) as "standard stock", plus one piece of furniture at any one time. There may be an additional "special stock" item for sale as well.

Traveling Cart prices may vary from visit to visit. Prices are usually quite inflated, but every once in a while an item can be sold for less than its normal price. Do note that items are sometimes found for sale outside their normal seasons, which can be helpful for completing bundles.

The cart is pulled by a pig wearing a fez and spectacles. Interacting with the pig will result in it oinking at the character. During the Night Market, the pig floats behind the cart in an inner tube.

## Guaranteed Red Cabbage

If the *Guarantee Year 1 Completable* advanced option was enabled when creating the save, the traveling cart is guaranteed to sell Red Cabbage Seeds at least once in the first year, between spring 7 in Cindersap Forest (the cart's second visit) and winter 16 at the Night Market (the cart's 30th visit). The day is selected at random when the save is created. The guarantee only applies on that single day, even if the player doesn't check the cart or buy the seeds on that day.\[2]

## External Links

Players with access to their saved game files may find the "Stardew Predictor" utility helpful for predicting which items the Traveling Cart will offer each week, and during the Night Market. The utility is located at https://mouseypounds.github.io/stardew-predictor/.

## Bugs

- For the Android and iOS version of the game, after buying something from the cart and closing and reopening the shop menu, the item can be purchased again. This can be repeated indefinitely.
