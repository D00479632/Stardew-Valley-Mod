## Buff duration and calculation reference

I was considering adding a game code reference to the Buff Duration Column Header on the Cooking#Recipes page.

Reference would be the following: Buff duration for Food and Drink appears in `Content\Data\ObjectInformation.xnb` at the 8th index. The given number must be then multiplied by 700 to have the duration in milliseconds. This formula appears in `Buff::Buff` in the game code.

I don't know if modifying the template is the best way to introduce a game code reference, but I'm not sure where else it could be mentioned. It could be added on the Buffs#Available Buffs page instead, but it makes the information more distant. It is also mentioned on Modding:Object data#Food &amp; Drink but without the reference to the `.exe` function.

Not the best idea to put a reference in a template. There is a section on the Cooking page called "Buffs", and that would be a much better place for the information. margotbean (talk) 22:49, 19 November 2021 (UTC)
