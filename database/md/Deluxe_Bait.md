Deluxe Bait cannot be used with the Training Rod or the Bamboo Pole. Only the Fiberglass Rod, the Iridium Rod, and the Advanced Iridium Rod can use bait.

Deluxe Bait can also be used in a Crab Pot, where it decreases the chance of catching trash (if the player does not have the Mariner profession) compared to using standard bait and increases the quality of Crab Pot fish to silver.\[3]
