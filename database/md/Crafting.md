From Stardew Valley Wiki

*For food items prepared in the kitchen, see Cooking.*

**Crafting** is the activity of creating a new item as specified by a crafting recipe. Similar to but separate from Cooking, each recipe lists a set of ingredient items that are consumed in each crafting action. The player knows ten crafting recipes at the start of the game, and must learn all others by gaining skills, developing friendships with townsfolk, and purchasing the rest from shops. Unlike cooked items, most (not all) crafted items are inedible.

The **Crafting menu** can be accessed by pausing the game (using E/ESC on PC, on Switch, on Xbox, on PlayStation) and navigating to the tab with a hammer icon. The recipes the player knows will be saturated, while recipes with missing ingredients are faded grey.

By mousing over each item, a popup shows the materials that you will need. Ingredient names written in red text are not currently in the player's inventory.

To craft an item, click on the item's icon once you have all the required ingredients. The newly crafted item will appear beneath the player's cursor, and the player can then place it inside their inventory. The crafting screen may expand to multiple pages once the player acquires a larger selection of recipes.

Crafting recipes are gained by leveling up skills, completing special orders, purchased from merchants, or received as gifts by gaining friendship points with villagers.

## Bombs

Bombs are one time use items which cause an explosion, damaging certain objects within their radius. Bombs come in multiple sizes.

Image Name Description Ingredients Radius Recipe Source Sell Price

Cherry Bomb Generates a small explosion. Stand back! Copper Ore (4) Coal (1) 3 Mining Level 1 data-sort-value="50"&gt;50g

Mega Bomb Generates a powerful explosion. Use with extreme caution. Gold Ore (4) Solar Essence (1) Void Essence (1) 6-8 Mining Level 8 data-sort-value="50"&gt;50g

## Fences

Fences block players, farm animals, and the spread of grass. The different fence types differ only in appearance and durability.

Fences will decay over time. When freshly placed, they'll drop the item when demolished. Otherwise they'll not drop an item, and will eventually become visibly damaged. Fences will disappear entirely if left in a damaged state for too long. A shortcut to replacing a damaged fence (other than hitting it with a tool and then replacing it) is to "use" the broken fence while a new fence is equipped in inventory. Your spouse may fix some broken-state fences daily before you leave the house.

Gates can be used to pass through fences, and closed to keep livestock (and other ground-pathing entities) contained. Torches can be placed on a fence.

Having a Gold Clock on the farm will prevent fences from decaying.

## Sprinklers

Sprinklers water crops automatically every morning at 6am. Sprinklers can be used to automatically water troughs in the Slime Hutch but they cannot water a pet's water bowl. Sprinklers will also not water plants in Garden Pots. They cannot be placed on sand.

This is the range of tiles each sprinkler can water without upgrades:

In addition to crafting them, Sprinklers and Quality Sprinklers may be purchased randomly from the Traveling Cart. Iridium Sprinklers can be purchased every Friday from Krobus for data-sort-value="10000"&gt;10,000g each. Quality Sprinklers may be received from opening a Mystery Box or Golden Mystery Box.

Sprinklers can be upgraded using the Pressure Nozzle or the Enricher.

## Artisan Equipment

Artisan Equipment is used to make Artisan Goods. Each device makes a specific set of goods, and can craft only one item at a time. Increased production requires multiple devices.

As with furnaces and all other equipment, the artisan good must be collected from the device before it can be used again.

## Fertilizer

*Main article: Fertilizer*

Fertilizer is used for boosting production on your farm. It may retain water, increase chance of better quality crops, or speed up growth. Some types of fertilizer must be used before a seed sprouts, and others may be used at any time. Only one type of fertilizer can be used on each tilled plot at any time.

## Seeds

Craftable seasonal wild seeds will grow the fruits/vegetables/flowers normally found as forage during the season. Craftable Ancient Seeds will grow Ancient Fruit. Craftable Grass Starter acts the same as that purchased from Pierre's General Store; once planted, it will grow and spread grass on the Farm.

Note: On Ginger Island, growing seasonal wild seeds will often destroy the tilled soil (and fertilizer), leaving untilled soil in their place after harvest.

## Decor

All types of flooring provide a +0.1 boost to Player Speed, but only if the flooring is located outside on the Farm. They also have the indirect benefit of preventing Grass or Trees from growing in heavily used areas, which would otherwise slow down or obstruct movement.

## Achievements

There are 3 Achievements associated with Crafting.

- D.I.Y. (Craft 15 different items)
- Artisan (Craft 30 different items)
- Craft Master (Craft every item)

The Wedding Ring does not count towards any of these achievements.

In the Options menu, checking the box next to "Show Advanced Crafting Information" will show how many items the player has crafted. Alternatively, users with access to their saved game files may find the "Stardew Checkup" utility helpful for tracking their Crafting achievement progress. The utility is located at: https://mouseypounds.github.io/stardew-checkup/

## Crafted goods outside the farm

It is possible to place crafted items outside the farm. If a villager walks through the square where a crafted item (other than a chest) was placed, the item will be destroyed.\[1] Chests will be moved out of the way.\[2] Areas that aren't visited by villagers, so are safe to place crafted items in, are the Backwoods, the Tunnel, the southern half of Cindersap Forest, the Quarry, and the Railroad above the tracks.
