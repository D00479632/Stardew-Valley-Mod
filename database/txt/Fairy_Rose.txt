The Fairy Rose is a flower that can be grown from Fairy Seeds in 12 days.
If grown within proper range of a Bee House (5 squares in any cardinal direction), a Fairy Rose will cause Fairy Rose Honey to be produced, increasing the honey base value from 100g to 680g. This is the most valuable type of honey, compensating for the poor profit margins on the flower itself.
Fairy Roses can be purchased from the Traveling Cart for 870–1,450g.

Bundles
Fairy Rose is one of the options for the Garden Bundle in the Pantry (Remixed).
Tailoring
Fairy Rose can be used in the spool of the Sewing Machine to create the dyeable Long Dress. The fairy rose can also be used as a red dye pot color for dyeing, located in 2 Willow Lane, Emily and Haley's house.
Quests
Fairy Rose is not used in any quests.
Notes
Fairy Roses have an equal chance of being one of six different colors. Fairy Roses of different colors will occupy different slots in inventory or chests. Six colors × four quality levels = 24 possible spaces used.
Despite not having a true red variation, Fairy Roses are used as a red dye in the dye pots.
Having at least one mature Fairy Roses on the farm by the end of a day increase the chance for the Crop Fairy event by 70% (from 1% to 1.7%).[1]
