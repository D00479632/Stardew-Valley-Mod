Foliage Print Can be placed inside your house. Information Source(s) Fishing in Island North Sell Price Cannot be sold

**Foliage Print** is a piece of furniture that hangs on a wall. It can be obtained by fishing in the river at the west of Island North.

When coming up from the southernmost entrance, turn left, go through a hidden path to reach a grove with a walnut bush, and then fish through the trees in the river to the left. The first time fishing there has a 100% chance of obtaining the painting (90% if the Dig Site bridge is repaired). Afterwards, each cast gives a 10% chance to obtain another painting (9% if the Dig Site bridge is repaired).\[1]
