## Reproduction

Cows, like pigs, sheep, and goats, have a low chance to reproduce and can produce baby cows. The more animals there are inside the same barn, the higher the chance an animal will give birth. When it occurs, the player will receive a notice at the bottom of the screen before the day starts, stating "During the night, \[parent's name] gave birth to a baby cow." Other than this, there is no indication that a cow is pregnant.

## Selling

Cows can be sold. The selling price is dependent on how many hearts the animal has (data-sort-value="1950"&gt;1,950g max).

To sell a coop or barn animal, right-click the animal after petting. The friendship/mood interface appears. Move the cursor over the gold coin button at the right to see how much you can sell the animal for. Click that button and the confirmation that follows to complete the sale.
