The **Wilted Bouquet** is a special gift that you can give to any or all marriage candidates whom you are dating.

Giving a wilted bouquet immediately ends the dating relationship and reduces the friendship level with the marriage candidate to 5 hearts (1250 points). However, unlike having a divorce with a spouse, you are still able to talk and give gifts to them.

A Wilted Bouquet is created by putting a Bouquet into a furnace (requires one coal). It will be finished crafting when the clock ticks over to the next 10-minute interval.

The bouquet can be sold for data-sort-value="100"&gt;100g via the shipping box, the same sale price as a regular Bouquet. Pierre will not buy them back.

## Tailoring

Wilted Bouquet is used in the spool of the Sewing Machine to create the Darkness Suit.

## Trivia

- Attempting to give your spouse a Wilted Bouquet will bring up a text box that says, "It wouldn't make sense to give this to &lt;spouse name&gt;.".
