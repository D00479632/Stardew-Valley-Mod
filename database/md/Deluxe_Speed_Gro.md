**Deluxe Speed-Gro** is a Fertilizer that speeds crop growth by 25% (or a total of 35% with the Agriculturist Profession).\[1] It can be crafted or purchased from Pierre's General Store for data-sort-value="150"&gt;150g from Year 2 onward, or purchased from the Oasis for data-sort-value="80"&gt;80g on Thursdays. Ten Deluxe Speed-Gro may also be received as a gift at the Feast of the Winter Star. Up to 100 Deluxe Speed-Gro may be purchased from Demetrius' shop at the Desert Festival for data-sort-value="2"&gt; 2 Calico Eggs each. 10-20 Deluxe Speed-Gro may be received from opening a Mystery Box or Golden Mystery Box.

Deluxe Speed-Gro can be placed on tilled soil *before or after* planting a seed, or at any stage of crop growth. It does not reduce time between harvests for multi-harvest crops.

Applying Deluxe Speed-Gro days after planting a seed still decreases the time it takes to fully grow, but it reduces a fixed amount of days per stage for each crop regardless of the day it's applied, and the reduction in stages that the crop has already passed will not retroactively apply. Combined with the fact that the reduction disproportionately affects earlier stages more, this means that its reduction to the rest of the growth time is much lower than the advertised percentage of 25%.\[2].
