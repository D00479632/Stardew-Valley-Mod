The Wood Lamp-post is a crafted lighting item that can be held or placed to provide light. The recipe can be purchased from the Carpenter's Shop for 500g.
The wood lamp-post influences a radius of approximately 7 tiles, with most of the illumination within the closest few tiles. The lamp can be placed indoors or outdoors, or in places like the Mines. It can be removed by striking it with a Hoe, a Pickaxe, or an Axe. Unlike the braziers, which can toggle on and off, the Wood and Iron Lamp-posts are always on. They provide more light than any other craftable lighting.
