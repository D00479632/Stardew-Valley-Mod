The Goby is a fish that can be caught at the bottom of the waterfalls in southern Cindersap Forest during any season. The waterfalls are located just east of the Abandoned House.
When fishing in the right area without using the Training Rod, there is a 15% chance to hook a Goby. This chance increases to 30% if using a Curiosity Lure. Unlike with other fish, the Locational Chance of the Goby is not multiplied by 66% if Goby Bait is used. Instead, its Locational Chance is increased by a static 20%. So the chance of hooking increases to 35-46% if using Goby Bait. These effects stack, so there is a 50-61% chance to hook a Goby with both a Curiosity Lure and Goby Bait.[1]

Tailoring
Goby can be used in the spool of the Sewing Machine to create the Fish Shirt. It can be used in dyeing, serving as an orange dye at the dye pots located in Emily's and Haley's house, 2 Willow Lane. It can also be used as a brown dye when used in the spool of the Sewing Machine with a dyeable clothing item in the feed.
Fish Pond
Goby can be placed in a Fish Pond, where they will reproduce every 4 days. The initial pond capacity is 3 fish, but the capacity can be increased to 10 by completing three quests. The only possible output is orange Goby Roe.

Notes
While the Goby has a theoretical maximum Size of 13", in actual gameplay it is impossible to catch a Goby longer than 11", due to the location where it is caught only having a maximum Fishing Zone of 2. A Fishing level of at least 16 is required to catch an 11" Goby.
An effective fishing level of at least 4 is required to cast into the waterfall pools. The waterfall illusion makes the pool appear 1 tile away, however, it is actually 5 tiles away on the map grid.
