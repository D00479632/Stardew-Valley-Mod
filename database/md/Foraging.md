**Foraging** is the skill associated with gathering wild resources found on the ground throughout Stardew Valley, and with chopping down Trees. Foraging skill also increases by harvesting crops grown from Wild Seeds.

Most forageables can be found throughout their season. One exception is Salmonberry, which can be found only during Salmonberry Season (Spring 15-18) on bushes around town. Blackberries can be found on the ground during Fall, but during Blackberry Season (Fall 8-11) they can also be found on bushes throughout town.

## Quality

The quality of foraged goods comes in four levels: regular, silver, gold, and iridium. However, only players who have chosen the Botanist Profession can find iridium-quality foraged goods. Higher quality goods command higher prices when the goods are sold, and deliver greater energy and health benefits when they are consumed. If given as a gift to an NPC who likes or loves it, a quality gift also provides a higher number of friendship points.

The Botanist profession applies iridium quality to:

- All items labeled as "Forage" in-game (except Sap and Cave Carrot, and buried items)
- Fruits, vegetables, and flowers found as forage (including Salmonberries and Blackberries shaken from bushes during their respective seasons)
- Coconuts shaken from Palm Trees
- Fruit left by fruit bats in the cave, provided the player chose that option when prompted by Demetrius (mushrooms are not affected)
- All items foraged from the beach except for Seaweed
- Crops grown from Wild Seeds
- Truffles

The Botanist profession does **not** apply iridium quality in these cases:

- Mushrooms that are not picked up from the ground. Notably, this includes mushrooms gained from tapping a Mushroom Tree or from the Farm Cave.
- Forage items that are dug up with a hoe, such as the Snow Yam and the Winter Root (in the wild).
- Seaweed.

### Quality Ratios

For players without the Botanist Profession, the game first tests for gold quality according to the following formula: `foraging level/30`. If the item fails this check, then the game tests for silver quality, according to the following formula: `foraging level/15 and not gold`, or `(1-foraging level/30)*foraging level/15`. If both checks fail, the foraged item will be of normal quality.

The table below shows the probabilities of obtaining each quality of foraged goods. The column for the average sell price represents how much more foraged goods would be worth, relative to their base price, if they were sold individually. However, some of the seasonal foraged goods can be crafted into Wild Seeds, and under certain circumstances, it is more profitable to sell crafted wild seeds than it is to sell the individual items (see Spring Seeds, Summer Seeds, Fall Seeds and Winter Seeds for details).

### Tracker Profession

The Tracker Profession makes spawned forageables in the current area easier to find. Small yellow arrows are added at the edge or corner of the screen that point towards each off-screen forageable (including inaccessible ones) and artifact spot. A similar small green arrow points towards any off-screen shimmering lights for panning. The tracker does not indicate berry bush locations.

## Experience Points

Experience points (XP) are granted as follows:

- **14 XP** for chopping down a tree with an axe (granted all at once for the last chop that causes the tree to fall).
- **2 XP** for removing the tree stump after chopping down a tree.
- **1 XP** for each Twig chopped down.
- **1 XP** for each piece of Moss harvested from trees.
- **1 XP** per berry for shaking Blackberries and Salmonberries off bushes in their respective seasons.
- **25 XP** for removing Large Stumps and Large Logs.
- **7 XP** for each foraged item picked up from the ground.
  
  - If the Gatherer profession doubles the foraged item, another **7 XP** is granted for the extra item.
- **7 XP** for each Ginger harvested.
- **3 XP** for each Spring Onion harvested from Cindersap Forest in Spring.
- **2 XP** for items grown from Wild Seeds (also 3 Farming XP).
  
  - If the Gatherer profession doubles the foraged item, another **2 XP** is granted for the extra item.
- **7 XP** for each item panned from panning. For instance, if the player obtained 3 items from panning, they will receive 21 XP.
- **5 XP** for each mushroom collected from the Farm Cave if the mushroom option was selected, and from Mushroom Logs.
- **7 XP** for each fruit collected from the Farm Cave if the fruit bats option was selected.
- **15 XP** for digging up a Seed Spot or Artifact Spot.
- **15 XP** for destroying a large Green Rain weed. \[1]
- **250 XP** for reading a copy of the Woodcutter's Weekly or Book Of Stars.

The 7 XP for foraging items applies solely to those items visible sitting on the ground that are picked up only if the player clicks on them; it does not apply to items lying on the ground (*e.g.,* dropped by shaking) that are automatically added to the player inventory by magnetism. Specific items that do grant 7 XP include:

- Standard randomly-spawned foraged items throughout Stardew Valley and Calico Desert.
- All items foraged from the Beach and the west side of Ginger Island.
- All fruit collected from the Farm Cave, if the fruit bat option was selected.
- All mushrooms collected from the Ginger Island Mushroom Cave.
- Truffles.
- Forage items spawned on the ground in the Mines and Skull Cavern, namely Red Mushrooms, Purple Mushrooms, and Fiddlehead Ferns.

**The following Items do NOT grant any foraging experience:**

- Trees or twigs felled by Bombs (however, weakening a tree with bombs before felling it with an axe will still give full XP).
- Grapes grown from Grape Starters (grants Farming XP instead).
- Items grown in Garden Pots.
- Items dug up by tilling soil in the Mines or Skull Cavern (*e.g.,* Cave Carrot)
- Mushrooms obtained from chopping or tapping a Mushroom Tree.
- Non-forage items spawned on the ground in the Mines and Skull Cavern, namely Quartz, Earth Crystals, Frozen Tears, Fire Quartz, and Dinosaur Eggs -- except that a bug causes any duplicates created by the Gatherer profession to give 7 XP.
- Forageables obtained from killing Monsters.

## Food

Certain cooked dishes will temporarily increase foraging level. Qi Seasoning can be applied to further increase the stat buff. This is useful for increasing Axe proficiency, or for harvesting more berries from each bush during Salmonberry or Blackberry season (up to a maximum of 4 berries can be harvested with Foraging level 12-13).

## Spawning

New forageable items can potentially spawn (appear) overnight on any exterior map.\[2] This section describes the rules used to spawn all typical forageable items. However, specialized items are handled differently and are described on their individual pages, namely Spring Onions in Cindersap Forest; Coral, Sea Urchins and Seaweed at the Beach; fruit in the Farm Cave; all forageables on the Forest Farm Map. Also, Salmonberry bushes, Blackberry bushes, Winter Roots, and Snow Yams don't spawn individual items.

There is a hard limit of six standard forageable items per map (*i.e.,* areas bounded by screen transitions) per week, reset on Sundays. Picking forageables does not reduce the weekly counter, so there is little-to-no advantage in picking forageables before Saturday (the day before the reset).

Only a subset of all the tiles on each map are valid spawning locations. On most maps, forageable items can spawn only on the green (grassy-type) tiles, and only on certain specific types of green tiles. The Beach and the Desert are exceptions, where spawning is possible on most yellow (sandy-type) tiles. Items never spawn in occupied locations (trees, chests, weeds, sticks, stones, etc.). They also never spawn in hidden tiles behind buildings, bushes, non-removable trees, or other permanent features. They can spawn behind removable trees (ones that can be chopped down; they also turn semi-transparent when the player walks behind them), but the spawn rate is 90% smaller in about half of the tiles behind a tree.

Therefore, the fraction of valid tiles differs for every map, which directly affects the chance of items spawning on each map. It is also affected by the player's actions. Removing debris (weeds, etc.) and chopping down trees can increase the number of valid tiles, whereas placing equipment (chests, etc.) may decrease the number. Planting trees can also have an effect: even though (on most maps) trees can be planted only in tiles where forage items can't spawn, they reduce the spawn chance in some tiles behind the tree (and also make it hard to find items that do spawn). However, these effects are generally small, unless a large fraction of the map tiles is occupied. All spawn rates are calculated assuming the default trees are in place and fully grown, but that all other tiles are cleared.

All uncollected forageable items are removed from the map overnight before Sunday morning and before the first day of a season.\[3] This cleanup applies both to standard forageable items and nearly all specialized items (fruit in the Farm Cave is the only known exception). Even non-season-specific items are removed at the start of a new season. To help repopulate the map, the chances of new items spawning are slightly higher on these days.\[4]

Forageable items will be destroyed if they are in the path of a villager.

## Bugs

- The Gatherer profession can cause some non-forage items to be doubled. When this happens, the player gains 7 XP for the duplicate item, even though the original item granted no experience. The items affected by this bug are items sitting on the ground in the Mines, namely Quartz, Earth Crystal, Fire Quartz, Frozen Tear, and Dinosaur Egg.
  
  - Other items found on the ground in the Mines, namely Red Mushroom, Purple Mushroom, and Fiddlehead Fern, are considered by the game to be forage items, so they always grant foraging experience, and any Gatherer duplication is not a bug.

## External Links

- Users with access to their saved game files may find the "Forage Finder" utility helpful for showing the location of all forageable items for the next game day. The utility is located at: https://stardew.selbysaurus.me/
