From Stardew Valley Wiki

**Achievements** are displayed on the player menu, under the "Collections" tab, on the "Achievements" tab found at the bottom left, on every platform other than Xbox. If playing the game on Steam or PlayStation, additional achievements are available.

Achievements can unlock specific rewards within the game. Achievements for specific platforms, such as Steam, only need to be achieved once, but the associated rewards must be earned separately for each new game.

Unearned achievements appear as grayed-out on the player menu. Some achievements do not display on the player menu until completing other achievements.

Most achievements unlock a unique hat for sale at the abandoned house in Cindersap Forest. In addition, the day after earning "Gofer" (Complete 10 Help Wanted requests), Mayor Lewis will send data-sort-value="500"&gt;500g in the mail. The day after earning "A Big Help" (Complete 40 Help Wanted requests), Mayor Lewis will send data-sort-value="2500"&gt;2,500g in the mail. The day after earning "Master Angler" (Catch every fish), Willy will send a Stardrop in the mail.
