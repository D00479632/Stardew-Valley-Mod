The Queen of Sauce 7 Summer, Year 2

Ingredients Carp (4)

**Carp Surprise** is a cooked dish. It is prepared using either the kitchen inside an upgraded farmhouse or a Cookout Kit.

**Note**: this recipe is profitable - it will result in profit when using the lowest quality ingredients. Turning the Carp into Sashimi will be even more profitable, however.

Carp Surprise may randomly appear in Krobus' shop on Saturdays, in the Garbage Can outside the saloon, or in the Stardrop Saloon's rotating stock. One Carp Surprise may be received from opening a Mystery Box.
