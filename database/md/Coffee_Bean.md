A **Coffee Bean** is a plantable seed that is also the crop harvested from the plants. Coffee Beans grow and mature 10 days after being planted (and every 2 days thereafter) in either Spring or Summer. The primary source of Coffee Beans is Dust Sprites, but they are only rarely dropped (1% chance). They may also randomly appear in the Traveling Cart's Special Stock for data-sort-value="2500"&gt;2,500g (25% chance in Fall/Winter) or Standard Stock for data-sort-value="15"100–1,000g (during all seasons). Coffee Beans cannot be purchased from any other stores.

When harvested, each plant gives four beans every two days, with a 2% chance for more beans. Basic Fertilizer and Quality Fertilizer affect only the first bean from every harvest.

Because Coffee Bean is fundamentally considered to be a seed (rather than a vegetable or fruit), its sale price does not benefit from the Tiller profession. Also, it cannot be placed into a Preserves Jar. However, 5 Coffee Beans can be placed inside a Keg to produce Coffee.

## Multi-Seasonal Crop

Coffee Beans may be planted in both Spring and Summer. There is no difference in their behavior in either season.

If a Coffee Bean plant (of any growth stage) is in the ground on the 28th of Spring, it will continue growing on the 1st of Summer as though nothing had changed. Fertilizer in the ground underneath a Coffee Bean plant on Spring 28 will not disappear on Summer 1.

## Crafting

In order to make Coffee, 5 Coffee Beans **from one stack** must be put into the Keg. It is not possible, for example, to place 3 Coffee Beans of silver quality and 2 of gold quality into a Keg, because the different quality levels are not stackable with each other, and the Keg will only accept 5 Coffee Beans at a time.
