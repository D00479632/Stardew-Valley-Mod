*See also: Mannequins*

The **Cursed Mannequin** is a piece of furniture that can be dropped by the Haunted Skull. If placed in the player's house, they can do a variety of things.

Each night, when the player goes to sleep, it has a chance to do one of three things.

1. It can swap the clothing items placed on the mannequin with the clothing items the player is wearing. If this happens, the mannequin will have eyes for a small time after the player wakes up.
2. It may move to a random place in the house, also having eyes for a short time.
3. It may change the wallpaper and flooring in the room it is placed in, and when the player wakes up, it will be violently shaking.

If the player rotates a cursed mannequin multiple times in a row, there is a chance it will display a "jumpscare" on the screen in which a cursed mannequin flies towards the screen with one of two faces. In another "jumpscare" the mannequins may also gain eyes and start looking around for a moment.

If a cursed mannequin is placed in the chapel in Pierre's General Store, it will become a normal Mannequin the next day.\[1]
