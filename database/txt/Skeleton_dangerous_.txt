Skeletons (dangerous) are an enemy found in the Mines after activating the Shrine of Challenge or during the Danger In The Deep quest. They can also be found in the Quarry Mine at any time. During the Desert Festival, they may spawn in the Skull Cavern if a certain Calico Statue effect is activated. 50 Skeletons (any type) need to be killed for the Monster Eradication Goal at the Adventurer's Guild.
Behavior
They behave identically to their weaker counterpart the Skeleton. They approach and attack the player by collision, but also have a longer-ranged bone throw attack, which passes through rocks.
Strategy
Simply hit them, and dodge any bones they throw.
