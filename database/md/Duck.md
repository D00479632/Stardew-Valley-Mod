## Trivia

- In the game, the female, egg-laying ducks have green heads. In actuality, male Mallard ducks have the characteristic green heads. Females are brown. However, domesticated Cayuga ducks have green feathers in both genders.
- Ducklings make the same noises as adult ducks.
- Ducklings will follow fully grown ducks around the farm.
- Ducks are unique in that if they swim on water, such as on the Farm Pond, Riverland or Beach Farms, they do not need to eat hay or grass to be fed overnight. This is indicated by a pecking animation while the duck floats on the surface.
