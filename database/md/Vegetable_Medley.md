**Vegetable Medley** (also called "**Vegetable Stew**" in the Cooking interface) is a cooked dish. It is prepared using either the kitchen inside an upgraded farmhouse or a Cookout Kit.

Vegetable Medley may randomly appear in Krobus' shop on Saturdays, in the Garbage Can outside the saloon, or in the Stardrop Saloon's rotating stock. One Vegetable Medley may be received from opening a Mystery Box. The Statue Of Endless Fortune produces one Vegetable Medley per year on Lewis' birthday, Spring 7.
