## Image delay

Hello Atravita! I see that you are probably experiencing a delay in image updating. Unfortunately, this is normal for the wiki, the server people tell me it can take up to 5 hours for an image to update and show correctly on a page. Even then, if you sign out, the old image may re-appear for a while.

Unfortunately, this can't be fixed, but please don't worry that your images aren't being uploaded properly. It just takes time to see them. I'm sorry about this, I have harrassed/pestered/bothered the server people to change it, but to no avail.

Thanks for all your hard work in updating the modding section for v1.5.5! And again, I'm sorry. If you ever find that an image hasn't updated after 24 hours, please leave a note on my talk page, and I'll get it sorted out. Thanks, margotbean (talk) 19:57, 16 December 2021 (UTC)

Thanks for explaining! Looks like it's updated itself by now Atravita (talk) 00:05, 17 December 2021 (UTC)

## Image Fuzziness

This has been a problem with Chrome for over a year. I looked at the page history for the sitewide CSS, and I was trying to fix it in October of 2021!

There's nothing I can do to fix it; Chrome refuses to accept either "pixelated" or "crisp-edges", I can't remember which. I believe it's not a problem with Firefox, if you want to use that instead. I use Chrome for the built-in translator (for what it's worth), and out of habit, but the change in image rendering has had me irritated for 13 months and counting. Not even the server peoples' suggestions have helped.

If you come up with anything, please do share it with me! margotbean (talk) 16:27, 13 November 2022 (UTC)

Oh, thanks for explaining! I'm actually on Firefox, not Chrome, but haven't updated my browser in...a while. Atravita (talk) 21:00, 13 November 2022 (UTC)
