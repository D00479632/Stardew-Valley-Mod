The **Void Egg** is an animal product obtained from a Void Chicken.

Initially, a Void Egg can be obtained through a random event involving a witch. The random event can occur as long as the player owns a Big or Deluxe Coop that is not full. The witch will fly over the coop during the night and leave a Void Egg inside.

A Void Egg can also be purchased from Krobus for data-sort-value="5000"&gt;5,000g. If the player is married to Shane, there is a chance he may present them with one as a gift on rainy days. A Void Salmon Fish Pond may produce a Void Egg when the population of the pond reaches 9.

A Void Egg sells for a base of data-sort-value="65"&gt;65g. This is data-sort-value="15"&gt;15g more than a Small Egg, but data-sort-value="30"&gt;30g less than a Large Egg.

A Void Egg can hatch a Void Chicken by placing it in a Big or Deluxe Coop's incubator.
