## Crafting ingredients

Hello! I see that you put a lot of work into creating ingredients tables for crafting, but normally large changes to a page require discussion first. So, when we think about adding ingredients to the Crafting page in the future, I would suggest a separate page that is linked to from the Crafting page.

I would also strongly suggest waiting until v1.6 is released, as ingredients may change significantly.

As for formatting, you matched the formatting of the Cooking page, which is good for consistency, but I think a more compact format would be better. Something like User:Margotbean/IngredientsShortList#Crafting. With such a compact format, a separate page wouldn't be necessary.

So, let's wait until v1.6 is released in 2 days, and revisit the issue then. All right? Again, I appreciate the hard work you did in compiling the list of ingredients! Thank you, margotbean (talk) 15:46, 17 March 2024 (UTC)
