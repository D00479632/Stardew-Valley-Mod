The **Bait Maker** is a piece of Refining Equipment that is used to create Targeted Bait from any fish. It takes 10m to process fish into bait. It can be crafted after reaching Fishing Level 6.

To use, insert any fish into the machine. It will then produce 5-10 "\[fish name] Bait," which will increase the chance of catching that fish when attached. Any fish can be used, including Legendary Fish and Crab Pot Fish. However, catchable items such as Seaweed, Algae, and Jelly cannot be put into the Bait Maker.
