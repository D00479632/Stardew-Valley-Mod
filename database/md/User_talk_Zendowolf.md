## Main Menu Mockup

I've created a sandbox page for you here: User:Zendowolf/Sandbox/MainMenu

Please let me know if you have trouble editing it there. The spam filters seem to be overly aggressive, and I'm not sure why. Thanks, margotbean (talk) 04:03, 22 February 2021 (UTC)

I've fixed the problem with the spam filter. You're still subject to new user "mass edit" restrictions, however, so make small changes for a while, and backup large changes in a text file on your hard drive! margotbean (talk) 04:57, 22 February 2021 (UTC)

User:Zendowolf/Sandbox/MainMenu now has mockup of what I was thinking... with caveats. To match my concept, Items would be one header instead of two, as would The Valley, and there would be no vertical whitespace between them. Other than that, it's pretty close to what was in my brain when I started. Zendowolf (talk) 08:17, 22 February 2021 (UTC)
