## Template Namespace

Unfortunately, I've felt it necessary to block you from using the Template namespace for the time being. You should not be blocked from using the Template talk namespace. As a new user, you've not listened when I said to read Help:Editing, and to digest what it said about discussing template changes before making them. Yes, you discussed one template change, but you also created a new template without discussion. I can tell you're enthusiastic, and you have a lot of ideas, and that's great. But not for this wiki, not before a major content release. I will reevaluate the block after v1.6 releases. margotbean (talk) 04:38, 11 December 2023 (UTC)
