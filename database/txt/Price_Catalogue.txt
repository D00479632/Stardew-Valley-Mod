Information
Source Bookseller
Sell Price 1,000g
The Price Catalogue is a power book that can be purchased from the Bookseller for 3,000g.
The first reading grants the player a power that allows them to view the sell price of any sellable item in-game. If an item is stacked or its price is affected by professions, then the sell price is displayed accordingly in the hover menu.[1] Once read, it can be found in the Player's Menu on the Special Items & Powers tab. Subsequent readings do not give any effects or additional XP.[2]

Trivia
This is one of the few items in the game that is spelled using British English instead of American English (where the -ue ending would be dropped, becoming catalog).
