## History Log

Just so you know, the "history log" already exists on the wiki, it can be found here: Version History. Cheese80 (talk) 09:14, 29 September 2024 (UTC)

## Help

Does anyone know how to delete a page? I want to delete that history log page. By the way, thanks Cheese80! - Insanity (talk)

## Help Again

Also does anyone know how to delete a category that does not show up in the page code? For some reason this user talk page gave itself the talk pages category instead of the user talk pages category and I can't figure out how to remove it - Insanity (talk)

## Bad edits

You have been banned from editing the main namespace of the wiki for repeated sloppy and bad edits requiring a lot of time to clean up. Please read Help:Editing. In particular, the following may be useful to you: *For social interactions and general gameplay questions, use the official forums, subreddit, or discord server.* margotbean (talk) 17:32, 29 September 2024 (UTC)

I have placed a notice on the talk page of the user who insulted you today. I want you to know that insults and swearing are wholly and totally unacceptable on this wiki, and any further such actions against you will result in a ban of the person making the comments.

I have asked that the person in question restore the suggestions they deleted as well. However, I would like to ask you to consider a couple of things before making new suggestions. (1) The wiki is not yet updated for v1.6.8, and v1.6.9 is coming soon. My "to do" list is overwhelming. I do not think the wiki will be completely up-to-date for another few years (yes, years, not months or weeks). (2) Every change made on the English wiki requires cascading changes in 11 other languages. So, adding a blurb to a page like "see also *name of page*" or adding a simple link is a ten-minute process at minimum. For **each** such change. And since my 'to do' list is long, I must prioritize larger projects. It's unlikely that I will be able to evaluate so many small requests, much less implement the ones that seem like a good idea. So, while I know you want very much to be helpful and to improve the wiki, making ten suggestions in a day is not the way to go about it. Please keep this in mind. Thank you, margotbean (talk) 02:02, 9 October 2024 (UTC)
