## Music

A placed Flute Block emits a sound when a player walks next to it, and then once per second if they stay near it. You can right-click a Flute Block to increase its pitch. There are 25 possible pitches, after which right-clicking again will reset to the first one.

You can place a series of Flute Blocks and Drum Blocks to create music as you walk along them.
