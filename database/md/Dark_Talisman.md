Dark Talisman Information Source Mutant Bug Lair Sell Price *Cannot be sold*

The **Dark Talisman** can be found in a chest in the Mutant Bug Lair. Obtaining it is part of the Dark Talisman quest. It is used to open the passage at the northeast end of the Railroad.

Once obtained, it can be found in the Special Items &amp; Powers tab in the Player's Menu. Oddly enough, it remains there even after using it.
