The **Sweet Gem Berry** is a crop that grows from a Rare Seed after 24 days. It is not considered a Fruit or Vegetable and cannot be used in a Keg or Preserves Jar, nor does it benefit from the Tiller profession.

Rare Seeds can be purchased from the Traveling Cart for data-sort-value="1000"&gt;1,000g in Spring &amp; Summer, or for data-sort-value="200"600–1,000g in any season. A Seed Maker can also produce Rare Seeds from a Sweet Gem Berry.

Despite its high sell price, the berry is regarded as a neutral gift by all the NPCs in Stardew Valley. When given to Old Master Cannoli in the Secret Woods, the player receives a Stardrop in return. In multiplayer, all players receive a Stardrop with the gift of a single berry.
