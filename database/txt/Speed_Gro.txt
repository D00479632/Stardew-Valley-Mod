Ingredients
Pine Tar (1)
Moss (5)
Produces 5 Speed-Gro per craft
Speed-Gro is a Fertilizer that speeds crop growth by 10% (or a total of 20% with the Agriculturist Profession)[1]. It can be crafted, obtained from a Bone Mill, or purchased from Pierre's for 100g starting on Spring 15th of year 1.[2] Twenty Speed-Gro is the reward for completing the Spring Crops Bundle in the Pantry.
Speed-Gro can be placed on tilled soil before or after planting a seed, or at any stage of crop growth. It does not reduce time between harvests for multi-harvest crops.
Applying Speed-Gro days after planting a seed still decreases the time it takes to fully grow, but it reduces a fixed amount of days per stage for each crop regardless of the day it's applied, and the reduction in stages that the crop has already passed will not retroactively apply. Combined with the fact that the reduction disproportionately affects earlier stages more, this means that its reduction to the rest of the growth time is much lower than the advertised percentage of 10%.[3].

↑ The change in phaseDays in HoeDirt::applySpeedIncreases is static regardless of the date of fertilizer application relative to the date of planting. This means that applying fertilizer after planting only affects the current stage and any stages thereafter, in the same way that applying at the same day as planting affects those stages.
History
