The Dandelion is found via foraging in the Spring, or grown from Spring Seeds. Up to ten can be purchased from Pierre at the Flower Dance. Up to five can also be purchased from Caroline's shop at the Desert Festival for 10 Calico Eggs each. It can randomly be found in Garbage Cans during Spring. Although it is a flower in its description (and in real life), the game classifies it as "Forage" and not "Flower."
