The **Orange Sapling** is a Fruit Tree sapling that takes 28 days to grow into an Orange Tree, after which it will produce one fruit each day during the Summer. Like all Fruit Trees, it will produce fruit all year round if planted in the Greenhouse.

It can be purchased from Pierre's General Store and occasionally from the Traveling Cart. It may occasionally be found in treasure rooms in the Skull Cavern, or as the second prize from the Prize Machine in the Mayor's Manor (50% chance). One Orange Sapling may be received from opening a Mystery Box or Golden Mystery Box.
