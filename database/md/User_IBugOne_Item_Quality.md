Some items may be obtained with a colored star marked on the bottom-left corner. For eligible items, there are four possible quality levels: basic (no star), silver, gold and iridium. Items with different quality levels do not stack and take up separate slots in the inventory or Chests.

Quality affects the usage of an item in the multiple ways, mainly:

- Quality items sell for more gold.
- Quality items provide greater healing effects when eaten (if edible).
- Quality items grant more friendship points when given as a loved or liked gift.
- Quality items are considered "more valuable" in festivals events, such as Luau and the Grange Display.
- Certain bundles and quests require quality items to complete.

Quality does **not** affect the usage of an item in the some ways. Cases include:

- Crafting
- Cooking
- Producing Artisan Goods with artisan equipments (except Ostrich Egg, which keeps the quality of the ingredient, and Wool, which affects the chance for multiple produce)
- Given as neutral, disliked or hated gift
- Completing most bundles and quests

### Crops

*Main article: Farming#Crop Quality Frequency*

Quality crops are possible at any time, although they're more common at higher Farming levels, and when fertilizers are used. Iridium quality crops are only possible when Deluxe Fertilizer is used.

Fiber and Qi Fruit always come in normal quality.\[1]

Fruit tree fruit are an exception: The longer a fruit tree has grown, the higher quality fruit it produces.

### Forage

*Main article: Foraging#Quality Ratios*

Similar to crops, quality forages items are more common at higher Foraging levels. Iridium quality forages are only possible when the player has chosen the Botanist profession.

### Fish

*Main article: Fishing#Fish Size &amp; Quality*

The quality of caught fish depends on multiple factors. Landing the bobber farther from land, having higher Fishing levels, performing a perfect catch and using a Quality Bobber are all contributing factors. See Fish Size &amp; Quality for a detailed breakdown on the fish quality mechanism.

### Cooking

*See: Qi Seasoning*

Gold quality cooked dishes are only possible with Qi Seasoning. Silver and iridium cooked dishes are not available.

In addition to the effects listed above, gold quality cooked dishes also have +1 level to all their buffs (excluding Speed buffs) and 50% more buff duration.

### Animal Produce

*Main article: Animals#Produce*

### Artisan Goods

*Main article: Artisan Goods*

Quality Mayonnaise can be produced from Large Eggs, Ostrich Eggs and Golden Eggs. Gold-quality Cheese and Goat Cheese can be produced from Large Milk and Large Goat Milk, respectively.

Some Artisan Goods may be aged in Casks to increase their quality, provided that the player has upgraded their farmhouse for a third time.
