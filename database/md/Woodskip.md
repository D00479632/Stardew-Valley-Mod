## Tailoring

The Woodskip can be used in the spool of the Sewing Machine to create the Fishing Vest. It can be used in dyeing, serving as an orange dye at the dye pots, located in Emily's and Haley's house, 2 Willow Lane.

## Fish Pond

Woodskips can be placed in a Fish Pond, where they will reproduce every 2 days. The initial pond capacity is 1 fish, but the capacity can be increased to 10 by completing four quests. Typical output includes orange Woodskip Roe and wood, but other tree-related products are possible starting at population 6.
