Rabbits who eat every day mature after 6 nights have passed. A mature and fed rabbit produces Wool every 4 days, which sells for 340g. They will drop it on their own so they do not need to be sheared. Once sufficient friendship and happiness are reached, a rabbit may produce a Rabbit's Foot instead of wool, which sells for 565g.
Wool can be placed in a Loom to produce Cloth, which sells for 470g.

Selling
Rabbits can be sold. The selling price is dependent on how many hearts the animal has (10,400g max).
To sell a coop or barn animal, right-click the animal after petting. The friendship/mood interface appears. Move the cursor over the gold coin button at the right to see how much the animal can be sold for. Click that button and the confirmation that follows to complete the sale.
Trivia
Pigs and rabbits are the only animals in the game for which both male and female animals are possible. However, rabbits are the only livestock animal that cannot reproduce.[1]
