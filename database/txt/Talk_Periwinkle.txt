Edible when smoked
Now, periwinkle and all other crab pot fish become edible once smoked. So now how should we do on their "Energy" sections? They are not edible when they are raw, but when smoked, will recover some energy and health, which are usually multipling by 1.5... ðŸ¤” Mmtraa7 (talk) 14:14, 2 December 2024 (UTC)
PS: I noticed the Fish Smoker article says:
The smoker accepts Legendary Fish as well as Crab Pot specific fish, making the latter now edible.
So NOT all Crab Pot fish become edible (but some of them)? Then, I have to revert some of my edit. But I wonder which fish are "specific fish"...?
This is why we learn the game first and edit after, once we are sure. margotbean (talk) 16:39, 2 December 2024 (UTC)
Edit: The phrase "crab-pot specific fish" means fish that can be caught in a crab pot. They cannot be caught using a fishing pole, they are specific to the crab pot. I had to read it 2x myself, but it makes sense and applies to all fish caught in a crab pot. margotbean (talk) 17:08, 2 December 2024 (UTC)
Thank you for explanation. Because of my poor English skill, I could not understand the specific meaning correctly. Now I see all smoked crab pot fish can be edible.
So then, how do you think about "Energy" matter? Crab pot fish are not eaten when they are raw, but they can be eaten and recover player's Energy and Health when smoked, and recovery quantity usually depends on their base (raw) recovery quantity.Mmtraa7 (talk) 17:37, 2 December 2024 (UTC)
Yes, I have that on my "to do" list. Have had it on my "to do" list since before release. margotbean (talk) 17:41, 2 December 2024 (UTC)
