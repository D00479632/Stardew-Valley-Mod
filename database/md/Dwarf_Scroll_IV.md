## Tailoring

Dwarf Scroll IV can be used in the spool of the Sewing Machine to create the dyeable Gold Trimmed Shirt. It can be used in dyeing, serving as a yellow dye at the dye pots, located in Emily's and Haley's house, 2 Willow Lane.

## Tip

- Level 95 in the Mines has tillable soil near the entrance to the floor. The player can repeatedly revisit Floor 95 via the elevator to till the soil and farm for Dwarf Scrolls I and IV.
