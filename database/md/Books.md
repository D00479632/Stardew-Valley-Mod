*Not to be confused with Lost Books.*

**Books**, when read, give players permanent advantages. They may grant abilities, quality-of-life upgrades, or experience points (XP) in the various game skills.

Books can be obtained in a variety of ways. Once found, a Book can be read by selecting it in the top row of inventory and selecting the "use" button (right-click on PC) as if consuming food. All books can be gifted to Penny as a loved gift.

In Multiplayer, the effects from a book will only apply to the player that reads them. Individual players will need to read individual books to receive their effects.

## Power Books

There are 19 power books. The first time each particular book is read, the player earns a power and the book is listed on the Special Items &amp; Powers player tab. Subsequent readings of most power books (besides the Animal Catalogue and Price Catalogue) grant XP in specific skills.

The Well-Read Achievement is awarded after reading all 19 power books at least once.
