**Bait** can be attached to a Fiberglass Rod, an Iridium Rod, an Advanced Iridium Rod, or inserted into a Crab Pot. Fishing rods do not require bait, but fish will bite faster with bait; specialized baits provide additional benefits. Crab Pots require bait to catch fish (unless the player has the Luremaster profession). Some specialized baits also provide benefits to Crab Pots.

Bait is always a single-use item. If the player uses a fishing rod with the Preserving enchantment, for each nibble there is a 50% chance for bait to not be consumed.

## Use

Requires: Fiberglass Rod, Iridium Rod, or Advanced Iridium Rod.

Each cast uses one piece of bait or one magnet. When all bait is used up, the game pops up a notification saying "You've used your last piece of bait."

To attach bait to a fishing rod, open the inventory, click on the bait ( left-click or right-click, depending on how many bait will be used), and then on the rod. To remove bait, on the rod.

On an Xbox controller, press on the bait to select the whole stack (or to pick up a single one), then to attach to the rod.

On a PS4 controller, press on the bait to select the whole stack (or to pick up a single one), then to attach to the rod.

On a Nintendo Switch Controller, Press on the bait to select the whole stack (Or to pick up a single one), then to attach to the rod.

Bait can be detached by pressing on either Controller. ( on Nintendo Switch)

For the mobile version, bait can be added to the fishing rod by opening the inventory, then dragging the bait and dropping it on top of the rod. Bait cannot be removed on mobile.

Although not listed in the description, it decreases the time taken for fish to bite by the same amount as Wild Bait, reducing the delay before a nibble by 62.5%.

Targeted Bait Increases your chances to catch (fish name). The fish must still be able to be caught in that area at that time, weather, and season. The bite rate is the same as for standard bait.

Targeted bait also works with Crab Pots, provided the player does not have the Mariner profession. Assuming the player does not have this profession, Targeted Bait decreases the chance of catching trash compared to using standard bait and increases the chance of catching the specific Crab Pot fish. The exact effect depends on the base chance of the targeted fish. Specifically:

- Lobster chance is quadrupled.
- Clam, Crab, and Oyster chances are tripled.
- All other Crab Pot fish chances are doubled.
