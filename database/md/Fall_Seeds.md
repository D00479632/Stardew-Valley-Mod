**Fall Seeds** are a type of Crafted seed. The crafting recipe is labeled "Wild Seeds (Fa)", but when crafted, the result is "Fall Seeds." Mature plants yield, at random, a Blackberry, Common Mushroom, Hazelnut, or Wild Plum.

Fall Seeds are one of the season-specific crafted wild seeds, along with Spring Seeds, Summer Seeds, and Winter Seeds that produce crops normally found as forage. While Farming Skill normally increases the chance to grow a quality crop, Foraging Skill increases the chance to grow a quality crop from Fall Seeds. Choosing the Botanist profession will ensure iridium-quality crops grown from Fall Seeds.

Crows do not attack crops grown from Fall Seeds, so the use of Scarecrows is unnecessary.

On Ginger Island, mature Fall Seeds may destroy the tilled soil (and fertilizer), leaving untilled soil in their place after harvest.
