## Turkish Version of Fishing Infograph

Hello, I'm a translator of Turkish Stardew Valley Wiki. I want to upload a Turkish version of your Fishing Infograph. Would that be a problem for you? Thanks. Peaw (talk) 11:19, 4 July 2024 (UTC)

Hello, I completed the translation and wanted to upload it to use on the Turkish wiki. It's not as good as yours, but it's still good enough for Turkish players! You can find them at File:Fishing Infograph Day TR.png and File:Fishing Infograph Night TR.png. Peaw (talk) 16:32, 4 July 2024 (UTC)

Oh! Sorry it took me so long to get back to you about this, I feel out of the habit of checking the discussion page haha. Of course it's no issue!!! Thank you for making a translated version to help even more people! Phralupe (talk) 18:57, 5 August 2024 (UTC)
