Display issue
Garden Pot page is using MediaWiki page template instead of Stardew Valley Wiki page template
Found this issue randomly; not sure if any other pages are affected. Tried a different browser, same issue. Other pages that I've looked at so far are fine.
Techhat (talk) 02:12, 25 January 2023 (UTC)
Try refreshing the page, or switching to "Desktop" view and then back. The wiki remembers your settings for some pages (for example, when I test mobile view on one page, some other pages will also display in mobile view, but not all of them.) Also make sure your "Preferences" are set to "Vector" and not "MinervaNeue". margotbean (talk) 14:34, 25 January 2023 (UTC)
I hadn't actually tested on mobile; this was on a desktop browser. I checked on my phone, and non-desktop mode shows the correct template. When I switch to desktop mode, it goes back to the wrong template. I had tested on both Chrome and Chromium on my PC and they both exhibited the same issue, with cleared cache and cookies. I also checked in empty profiles in Firefox and Edge (both on PC) and they both exhibit the same issue. Techhat (talk) 14:43, 25 January 2023 (UTC)
Ok, when I open any wiki page in an incognito tab (using Chrome browser on a desktop), then click "mobile view", the skin is MinervaNeue. That shouldn't happen. I'll let the server people know. Thanks! margotbean (talk) 15:02, 25 January 2023 (UTC)
The server people are working on a fix, but for now, you can purge the page, and that should make it display correctly. Just click in the url bar in your browser, and go to the end of the address, then type (or copy/paste) ?action=purge, then hit "enter". Hope this helps! margotbean (talk) 18:28, 8 February 2023 (UTC)
Display problem of the german version of the homepage
Good day all, since some time the German version of the homepage makes some display errors left missing the background frame and overlaps with the text of the post and top in the header is the display not quite right.
I have made a screenshot of it: BigLink (talk) 04:53, 18 March 2023
I will inform the server people of the problem. In the meantime, you can use the Google Chrome browser, or sign in to your account, and make sure to check the box that says "keep me signed in". The issue only appears to affect users who aren't signed in.
Thanks for reporting this! margotbean (talk) 16:07, 18 March 2023 (UTC)
Update -- the server people have fixed the issue. Please report back if it happens again. Thank you, margotbean (talk) 17:38, 18 March 2023 (UTC)
I see the same thing on the English wiki, but only when not logged-in. = Paul2520 (talk) 16:02, 8 May 2023 (UTC)

AbuseFilters 7 and 8
I've noticed you've used those filters to make makeshift title and username blacklists. Because AbuseFilter runs on every action, these would be better served by MediaWikiWiki:Extension:TitleBlacklist.
(That said, I'm sure that 2 extra AbuseFilters running on your 30-ish daily actions is causing dozens of bytes of additional RAM to be consumed on your server hardware. :P) Snowmanonahoe (talk) 20:55, 19 May 2023 (UTC)
The images are being really weird
This hasn't always been this way but I don't know when it started
Hello dear Admin. I'm not sure what's going on but this has been happening for months however it hasn't always been like this. I can't remember when it started but it's been at least I believe six months. I thought it could have been my extentions but I tested and it wasn't. I'm using Opera GX and I checked with Google and this didn't happen. Could it be Opera GX interacting in some way? Is it a glitch? The only way I can describe it is that it looks like black and white were inverted and maybe the color contrast was cranked up. Any idea how to fix this if it's not a bug? Tiptoe50 (talk) 17:47, 4 June 2023
Check your browser extensions for something labeled "dark theme" or with the word "dark" in it, and disable it. Or, turn off "Force dark pages" in Advanced settings. If that doesn't work, I can't help you. Send feedback to the developers of the browser asking for help, and you might find more useful tips. margotbean (talk) 23:02, 4 June 2023 (UTC)
Vandalism
I don't know if it's necessary to report it or not, but User:Mike. vandalized the Ginger Island page. I have edited it out. IntricateSpiral (talk) 16:28, 6 August 2023 (UTC)
Hello IntricateSpiral! It's not necessary to report all instances of vandalism, but thank you for cleaning up!! margotbean (talk) 19:43, 6 August 2023 (UTC)
Need to update the image showing the version on the homepage
The homepage has an image at the top saying "Stardew Valley 1.5". It is now 1.6. I have attached another image with the 1.6 version from Concerned Ape's blog if you want to use that.
Trying to update mystery box page
I was trying to edit the contents on the Mystery Box page to be in charts like how the geode content tables are organized, but I got the pop-up that it was too big of an edit for a new editor to make. I don't know if this is the best way to alert someone that I am trying to do this genuinely, or if someone here can even grant me the permission to make that edit. If someone else has to make the edit, that's understandable, but I was really excited to do it! RaeOSunshine24 (talk) 20:48, 25 March 2024 (UTC)
Don't know how to solve this but just curious on your approach, have you considered a table like Treasure Chests as well? Or you like to split it like Geode like you mentioned? YuvixAdun (talk) 21:17, 25 March 2024 (UTC)
My first instinct was to have the items split into multiple charts because there are so many different categories of items (crafting, clothing, special items, recipes, etc.) but I'm not married to it! This has just been a cool outlet for me to kind of learn coding related to something I'm very interested in. Any help or advice is appreciated :) RaeOSunshine24 (talk) 22:23, 25 March 2024 (UTC)
I changed my approach and am now trying to adjust it just so it matches the content chart on the Golden Mystery Box page, but that's still too big of an edit apparently :( again, someone else is welcome to do it, I just find the current way it's organized hard to read! RaeOSunshine24 (talk) 12:26, 26 March 2024 (UTC)
Unable to confirm email address
I have recently made an account for this wiki, but it seems like the email confirmation is broken, as it never sent me an email and every time I try to have it send one or I replace the email I get the following error code:
"Stardew Valley Wiki could not send your confirmation mail. Please check your email address for invalid characters. Mailer returned: Failed to send data [SMTP: Invalid response code received from server (code: 554, response: Message rejected: Sending paused for this account. For more information, please check the inbox of the email address associated with your AWS account.)] "
It has been hours since I first tried to confirm my email, but it has sent nothing. I am positive I entered my email address correctly, it seems to be an issue with whatever sends the emails with the confirmation links.

Request move of page Joja Catalogue
Hi there, please move Joja Catalogue to Joja Furniture Catalogue – that's what it is called in game. :)
Require Permissions to flesh out Wallpaper page
I just attempted to flesh out the Wallpaper page to break up the giant table and indicate the sources of various wallpapers, including the two unobtainable wallpapers, but it was flagged as too large an edit for a new user. It would be much appreciated if I could have this restriction lifted somehow. Sicarious (talk) 08:25, 12 April 2024 (UTC)
The restriction will be automatically lifted once you have made 25 edits, if I recall correctly. User314159 (talk) 16:06, 12 April 2024 (UTC)
It's a bit more than that. Please read Help:Editing, and make changes to the page in smaller increments, saving in-between. Thanks, margotbean (talk) 18:43, 12 April 2024 (UTC)
Okay, that got it to work, thanks. Had to break it up quite a bit more than expected, but it's all good now. I don't know if I should clean up this topic myself or not, so I'm just going to leave it for now.Sicarious (talk) 06:42, 13 April 2024 (UTC)
Adding external links to Modding:Mod compatibility
I am trying to edit the page of Modding:Mod compatibility and update the mods to their unofficial version that I found on github however I'm blocked because I'm adding external links. I've made more than a dozens of edits to contribute to this page which shares its data with smapi.com/mods for a lot of users. I tried copying the format of other mods who had "github.com" in their block of code but couldn't have my changes accepted as the format was impossible to mimic. I've encountered an automatic message to message moderator and when searching for that word i was directed to this section of the site, I hope this is the correct procedure to go
In short I'd like a solution for a workaround or permission to add these two block of codes as replacement to the currently mods with the status broken (it might be better to view the text below in source code along with the mod page in source code on the side to understand better):
{{#invoke:SMAPI compatibility|entry
  |name    = Always On Server for Multiplayer
  |author  = funny-snek and Zuberii
  |id      = funny-snek.Always_On_Server
  |nexus   = 2677

  |broke in = Stardew Valley 1.4

Hi! We have link templates for a few whitelisted sites to avoid the spam filter. For example, {{github|perkmi/Always-On-Server-for-Multiplayer}} produces https://github.com/perkmi/Always-On-Server-for-Multiplayer. —Pathoschild (talk) 19:37, 15 April 2024 (UTC)
Request move of Dehydrator Productivity from user space
Productivity information was removed from Dehydrator in edit Special:PermanentLink/168482. I've created separate pages in user space with that information to clean it up a bit and bring it in line with Keg Productivity pages. They're in a reasonable state to be published now and can be moved. The following pages can be moved:
User:My hat stinks/Drafts/Dehydrator Productivity to Dehydrator Productivity
User:My hat stinks/Drafts/Dehydrator Productivity - Tiller to Dehydrator Productivity - Tiller
User:My hat stinks/Drafts/Dehydrator Productivity - Artisan to Dehydrator Productivity - Artisan
After the move we should also set up a template Template:DehydratorProductivity-top to match Template:KegProductivity-top. Alternatively we can make a more general-purpose template since it breaks the rule of 3 (it's also used on Preserves Jar Productivity and presumably will be on Cask Productivity), but that's a separate discussion.
My hat stinks (talk) 10:50, 23 April 2024 (UTC)
When 1.6 is settled (meaning no more "balance changes" will be made) and you've explained what "5p" and "1p" are on the pages, and fixed the text that links to "Keg", then I will consider moving the pages. In the meantime, please avoid creating redlinks. I understand that was probably for my convenience, but it's not necessary. Thank you, margotbean (talk) 20:28, 23 April 2024 (UTC)
"No more balance changes" is a literally impossible goal and not followed anywhere else on the wiki (i.e. every other 1.6 change is documented without contest), but I've made the other changes. It's worth noting that if this page was not in user space any user could make such improvements. My hat stinks (talk) 21:20, 23 April 2024 (UTC)
It has been 8 minor revisions (including 4 balance changes affecting other areas documented on this wiki) since dehydrator balance was changed. What is your threshold for "no more balance changes", and why does it only apply to this page? Will this page not be editable in future? My hat stinks (talk) 08:30, 6 May 2024 (UTC)
Version 1.6.9 is still in the works, but it seems to be bugfixes at this point. I see that you've corrected the things I mentioned. If you want to move the pages and make an attempt to create the new template in all 12 languages, you can move them to the main space. You can leave the template untranslated in the other languages, and add the appropriate "translate" template at the top, inside <noinclude>...</noinclude> tags. margotbean (talk) 16:38, 6 May 2024 (UTC)
Making edits to Elliott's 14 heart event
Hello! I couldn't figure out how to contact site admins directly so I'm making a post here. I wanted to update Elliott's 14 heart event with the contents of the six letters that he sends the player but it was blocked because it was a lot of text and my account is new. Is it possible to let me edit that section? Thank you! Smolpango (talk) 18:28, 28 April 2024 (UTC) Smolpango
Hungarian wiki broken
Hi, I don't know if you know this already, but for me there seems to be something wrong with the Hungarian wiki. The sidebar is overlapping the main text. Cheese80 (talk) 17:36, 1 May 2024 (UTC)
Yes, I can see the problem when I open the tab "incognito" view. Does it happen when you're signed into the wiki? margotbean (talk) 21:02, 1 May 2024 (UTC)
I've reported the problem (again) to the server people. This is a recurring problem, and the workaround is to sign in. I'll see if they can fix this problem (again!), and thanks for letting me know! margotbean (talk) 21:12, 1 May 2024 (UTC)
It looks like it's now been fixed. Thanks for your help! Cheese80 (talk) 07:18, 2 May 2024 (UTC)
Crop Growth Calendars for New 1.6 Crops: Agriculturist and Speed-Gro Comparison
Hello, I'm not entirely sure how to contact administrators directly so I'm posting here. I did testing on all the new crops (Carrot, Summer Squash, Broccoli, and Powdermelon) and formatted everything to add to the Crop Growth Calendars page, but my edit was blocked as I'm a fairly new user. I have all 6 "sub-calendars" ready for all the crops and have the code written out ready to add in. Everything is in line with the existing formatting / layout and the preview looked perfect. I'd love to get these added for everyone to use but I'm assuming my account needs to be approved or something along those lines. I read the Help Editing page in advance and went out of my way to make a handful of minor edits and even made sure to add and verify my email before I tried adding these, but it seems that wasn't enough to allow me to add the calendars. I'm hoping this is the correct place to post this--please let me know what I need to do so I can get these added. Thank you so much!! KrobusFanClub (talk) 08:51, 6 May 2024 (UTC)
I've uploaded a screenshot of the edit preview for the Powdermelon Crop Growth Calendars to show what I'm trying to add. I made more minor edits in an attempt to clear the threshold but I'm still unable to add these in. I'm not sure if there's a certain number of minor edits I need to hit, a time window I need to reach, or possibly both--all would make sense, and I completely understand why these limitations are in place! I just really want to add these calendars in so just let me know what I have to do on my end to make that possible. I'll mark that screenshot to delete as soon as I can get this resolved. Thanks again :) KrobusFanClub (talk) 12:25, 6 May 2024 (UTC)
Hello KrobusFanClub! There's no magic box I can check for you, you simply have to keep making smaller edits and saving in-between. margotbean (talk) 16:42, 6 May 2024 (UTC)
Makes sense, thanks for the response. Can I ask if there's a magic number I need to hit or should I just keep trying occasionally after making more edits? Also, is it best practice to remove these sections on this page once they're resolved, or should I leave it up? Sorry for the newbie questions, I appreciate you!! KrobusFanClub (talk) 05:26, 7 May 2024 (UTC)
I was able to make the edits and add the calendars! There's a formatting "issue" that's bothering me for the Carrot tables but I've posted on the discussion page asking about that. Thank you so much for all your work maintaining this wiki, you are appreciated more than you know!! KrobusFanClub (talk) 07:33, 7 May 2024 (UTC)

Sardine entry in english wiki not rendering properly
Related posts: https://www.reddit.com/r/StardewValley/comments/1dms18r/what_happened_to_the_wiki/ and https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Stardew_Valley_Wiki:Admin_noticeboard#Hungarian_wiki_broken
Issue: When loading https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Sardine , the render is not what should be.
Sardine bad render
How to reproduce: Loading https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Sardine without being logged in.
Observation: All stardewvalleywiki.com pages send a query to /mediawiki/load.php?lang=en&modules=jquery&skin=vector&version=tqh7e, except for this one. This one tries to load way more things than needed and they mess up with the render. The query being made in the Sardine's entry is the following:

adding of externals links in Modding|Installing SMAPI on Linux
Hello! I wanted to rephrase the installation instructions for NixOS in Modding:Installing SMAPI on Linux as I got a little bit confused by my own instructions I added a year ago. I had the same problem with the spam filter back then. I didn't change any links, just rephrased the instructions, to make them more clear. Mariechen (talk) 18:06, 16 July 2024 (UTC)

User being rude on talk page

Ya, very rude! Block him please! How old are you kid? Hahahahahahahahhahahaha骑凤散人 (talk) 01:03, 9 October 2024 (UTC)
Are you kidding guy? 骑凤散人 plays an important role in Chinese wiki! He updated more than 500 pages. So???????? I don't want to say anymore... Candybear (talk) 14:57, 11 October 2024 (UTC)
Significant contributions to the wiki do not excuse swearing and the abuse of another editor. Because of his long history of contributions, he was given a strong warning rather than being immediately banned. He chose to remove himself from the wiki rather than to behave as a civilized adult. margotbean (talk) 17:55, 11 October 2024 (UTC)
Repeatly meaningless discussions
I don't want to judge who's right or wrong in this minor incident, but I came to check things out since I saw them complaining about this.
Given that Insanity Studios has been banned in the main namespace due to repeated bad edits, do we really need to keep his permissions in the discussion namespace? Unless you genuinely believe that his constant suggestions will contribute anything meaningful to the wiki?
I don't want to come off as impolite. We understand the efforts that go into maintaining the wiki as administrators. If that's the case, why allow behavior that only adds unnecessary workload?
I understand there's a rule in the discussion space about Don't delete discussions, but does that mean I can post anything at will, including meaningless content or even spam? We want to make the wiki better, but do we really need to tolerate and make concessions for this kind of behavior?
So, what do you say? - 时舟（讨论） 19:05, 11 October 2024 (UTC)
Hello, Margotbean! I hope you are doing well.
We have to use firm statements to stop that disruptive individual from editing; we have no other choice. I reminded him to read Help:Editing, but it was not helpful. He continues to create chaos on the talk page. All of his ideas seem meaningless, and no one is willing to incorporate them into the pages.
骑凤散人 attempted to clean up the mess, but you reverted his edits. I empathize with both him and you. However, it is difficult to determine who is right or wrong in this situation. You mentioned, all hope this wiki becomes the best wiki. all share that sentiment. Both you and we are doing our best to make that a reality.
I hope we can completely ban the creator of the mess. I know that using rude statements is wrong; we should be more polite in reminding him of that. Could you please think twice? All of us are looking forward to seeing you change your mind.
Have a nice day! — Candybear 09:56, 12 October 2024 (UTC)

Locking Caroline
Might want to lock Caroline so people stop reverting her horseradish preferences as of 1.6, similar to Evelyn Kailey0426 (talk) 14:40, 23 October 2024 (UTC)
Locking the page is a bit drastic; we could try other options first, like a <!-- This reflects her gift tastes in Stardew Valley 1.6+ --> comment in the code. That said, all current platforms will have 1.6.9 in two weeks, so it won't be an issue for much longer. —Pathoschild (talk) 15:22, 23 October 2024 (UTC)
Makes sense, I mostly suggest it because that was just done for Evelyn and Alex after lots of silliness moving clams back and forth from liked/hated and such. Once I'm at my computer I'll see about tacking that notice on to NPCs with gift taste changes in 1.6, at least for the next couple weeks. Maybe it'll help prevent a bit of chaos come console 1.6 launch. Kailey0426 (talk) 19:27, 23 October 2024 (UTC)

Change version numbers to 1.6 on the main page
Hello,
I just noticed that the new update 1.6.9 is currently not listed on the main page, but it has been released for iOS / iPadOS, Android, Nintendo Switch, Xbox and PS4 / PS5. I wanted to ask an admin if he/she can edit the main page to change the version numbers.
Thanks and goodbye, Atten007 :)

Server instability Nov 2024
Is there something going on with the wiki server? Since 1.6.9 released my bookmarked searches have been failing even though the URLs match the local search URL format precisely. Searching locally is also very slow. I just tried to log in to post about it and the server crashed entirely for a few minutes leaving only the Cloudflare cache, which is obviously only viable for anons. Previewing and submitting this question has also been really slow. Half of my pageloads have no CSS or partial CSS. Is it just excessive normal traffic? Have you blocked remote referers from searching? OnionNinja (talk) 02:21, 20 November 2024 (UTC)
It's not normal traffic, and the server people are working on implementing a permanent solution. We all must have patience. margotbean (talk) 11:04, 20 November 2024 (UTC)
Furniture large edit revert
I thought that the formatting was really bad on that page. The first issue was that tons of unneded and obvious info was repeated, like the fact that all catalogue items cost 0G when bought in the catalogue. The second issue was with the user experience - it was really hard to tell at a glance which items were available from a catalogue and which weren't. All in all, it seemed like the tables were prioritizing space efficiency over user experience.
So, I decided to remake it, and you can see my finished result here. 10 hours later, it was reverted without explanation. I don't want to start an edit war, so I'm requesting the permission to revert it back and assurance that it won't be reverted again.
Also, the icons I uploaded for use in the rewrite were deleted without explanation as well.
My apolocheese, I read the rules and it seems like I needed to discuss the edit with others if it's a large formatting edit. Let this be a discussion thread then
Actually, I'll move this to the Furniture talk page
