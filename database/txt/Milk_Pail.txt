Milk Pail
Gather milk from your animals.
Information
Cost: 1,000g
Sold by: Marnie's Ranch
The Milk Pail is a tool used to gather milk from cows and goats. It must be purchased from Marnie's Ranch for 1,000g.
Each use of the Milk Pail to milk a cow or goat consumes 4 points of energy, and increases the player's Farming experience by 5 points.
Using the Milk Pail on an animal other than a cow or goat will produce the message "[Animal name] doesn't produce milk."
Once the player has reached Farming Level 10, an Auto-Grabber can be purchased from Marnie's Ranch for 25,000g, which will automatically milk all cows and goats from the barn in which it is placed.
