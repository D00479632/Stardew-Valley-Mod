**Milk** is an animal product obtained from a Cow by using a Milk Pail. It can also be obtained from Sandy on Saturdays, who will comment that the player looks thirsty. Additionally, it is sold by Alex during the Desert Festival for data-sort-value="10"&gt; 10 Calico Eggs.

When a cow has a sufficient friendship and mood level, it can produce a Large Milk, which is more valuable.
