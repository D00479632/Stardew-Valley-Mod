Slimes are enemies that can be found in various locations, including The Mines and the Secret Woods. They come in five different variations, all based on the same sprite and code (a color hue is added to the grey sprite found in data files). 1000 Slimes (any color) need to be killed for the Monster Eradication Goal at the Adventurer's Guild. All Slimes in the game count towards this goal (e.g., in the Secret Woods) except for Big Slimes and Slimes raised in a Slime Hutch (by means of a Slime Incubator or Mating). Slimes spawned by killing a Big Slime do count towards the goal.
Each color of slime has a unique stat set.
Depending on the player's Combat Level, certain Slimes can spawn on the Wilderness farm by default. This is true for any farm type, if the player has activated the Dark Shrine of Night Terrors or enabled monsters in advanced options when starting a new game. Slimes slain on the Farm will only yield 1/3 of their normal experience points.[1]

Attacks
Slime attack zone
All colors of slimes, both male and female, have an attack zone of 4 tiles in all directions. If the player enters this zone, the slime will attack.
Slimes attack in two ways. Either they bounce slowly at the player, or they "charge" to jump at the player from a distance. The charging animation resembles the slime becoming almost flat to the ground. If there is an obstacle in the way, the charge jump will cause them to bounce off the object (sometimes multiple times if they're in a tight spot). Occasionally slimes will enter a state of rage after being attacked, causing them to move significantly faster and have red eyes.
Being hit by a slime reduces health and may cause the Slimed debuff. These effects can be prevented by equipping a Slime Charmer Ring.

Strategy
When a slime is hit, it will be knocked back a short distance, out of range of melee weapons. The best strategy to kill slimes is to quickly move into striking distance to prevent their charge attack and corner them upwards or sideways against a wall or, ideally, in a corner (of walls, rocks, or both). Both the charged and regular attacks may be avoided by using a defensive move (such as the block of the regular sword). Timing a block with a sword well can allow the player to get a decent amount of damage. Otherwise, offense is the best defense.
The Slime Charmer Ring prevents all damage from Slimes. This ring is obtained as a reward for killing 1000 slimes for the Adventurer's Guild.
Male Slimes
Any slimes have a 49% chance to be male and will retain its original properties such as being special. Male slimes have a pom-pom like antenna dangling above their "heads", 25% more health over the base HP, and 1 more damage. When it is passive and is attacked, male slimes have a 2.5% chance to increase its damage by 50% and do a shaking animation.

Mating
Iron Slimes mating in the Quarry Mine
In a Slime Hutch or (less commonly) The Mines, Secret Woods, Skull Cavern, Tiger Slime Grove, or Quarry Mine, male and female slimes may mate to produce a small slime that will grow into either a male or female adult slime. This can also occur on the farm if monster spawns are enabled at the Dark Shrine of Night Terrors or the Wilderness farm. If so, the resulting child slimes will not despawn overnight, theoretically enabling slime farming without a Slime Incubator.
Mating Color Results
The game randomly picks a method from the following table to determine how the color will be calculated. Using this chosen method each of the red, green, and blue color components of the slime is then calculated independently using the values from the parent Slimes. The most likely method has a separate roll for each color component to determine whether the maximum or the average of the parents' components will be used. [2]
Chance Each Color Component (Red, Green, or Blue)
25% Male Parent Component +/- random 25%
25% Female Parent Component +/- random 25%
50% 50%: Maximum of (Male Parent Component or Female Parent Component)
50%: Average of (Male Parent Component and Female Parent Component)

Big Slimes
Big Slimes have an attack behavior that's similar to the smaller slimes. When killed they have a 75% chance to split into 2-4 smaller slimes that also attack the player. Those small slimes give XP as the regular slimes above do.
Big Slimes may appear on slime-infested floors of the Mines in the color for that section of the Mines. They are most common in the Skull Cavern, where they can be found on any floor as Big Purple Sludges. Big Purple Sludges have a chance to drop additional items during certain of Mr. Qi's Special Orders. When they hold such a drop, they appear semi-transparent so that the drop may be seen within beforehand. They must be killed to get the drop. During the "Qi's Hungry Challenge" Special Order, they may drop a heart that heals 10 HP.

180 10 0 2 21
240 15 0 2 21 Skull Cavern
Big Slimes can also be found when The Mines or the Skull Cavern are in a dangerous state. They should then be considered dangerous slimes, relatively stronger by 2x health and attack, as with small slimes. Dangerous Big Purple Sludges, which may appear during the "Skull Cavern Invasion" Special Order, may drop a Qi Gem (10% chance) or Galaxy Soul (0.45% chance).[7]
Prismatic Slime
Prismatic Slime
The Prismatic Slime is a special monster that can be found in the Mines, Quarry Mine, or Skull Cavern on any level, after accepting the Wizard's Special Order "Prismatic Jelly". It looks like a regular slime that changes color over time. The Prismatic Slime can appear when the mines are in either state: normal or "dangerous".
A Prismatic Slime will always drop the Prismatic Jelly that must be delivered to the Wizard in order to complete the Special Order.
While the special order is active, each slime spawned in The Mines, Quarry Mine, or Skull Cavern has around a 1.2% chance to be replaced with a Prismatic Slime, depending on daily luck. The exact chance is 0.012 + Daily Luck / 10.0. Note, however, that the chance cannot drop below 0.01, so the chance is 0.01 whenever daily luck is less than -0.02. [5]
Note that a Prismatic Slime has very high HP (1000) and damage (35), and is thus considerably stronger than the slime it replaces.
Dangerous Slimes
Green stacked slimes
Dangerous Slimes are a variation that can be found on any level of the Mines after accepting Mr. Qi's challenge "Danger in the Deep". Successful completion of this quest activates the Shrine of Challenge on level 120. Thereafter, the shrine can toggle the mines overnight, alternating between the dangerous state and the normal state. If not toggled the first time, the mines stay dangerous. Dangerous Slimes replace regular slimes and appear as a larger slime with sunglasses and a smile. They are relatively stronger than their normal variations, with 2x health and attack.
Dangerous slimes also appear on any level of the Skull Cavern during either of Mr. Qi's Special Orders "Skull Cavern Invasion" or "Qi's Hungry Challenge". The Skull Cavern is dangerous only during one of these quests.
Sometimes these slimes will appear stacked on top of each other. This variation is called a Stacked Slime. When hit with a weapon, the top slime will come flying off similar to a Squid Kid projectile. The Slime Charmer Ring does not grant immunity to this attack. After all slimes are knocked off, the bottom one works as a normal slime.
Dangerous Green Slime
Dangerous Blue Slime
Dangerous Red Slime
Dangerous Purple Slime
Gold Slimes
Gold Slimes are a variation that can be found in all mines (The Mines, Skull Cavern, the Quarry Mine and the Volcano Dungeon) and the Secret Woods. Slimes have a 0.1% chance of being turned into a Gold Slime, which sees their color turned yellow (RGB value (255, 255, 50)). In addition to the regular drops of the slime it replaces, a Gold Slime is guaranteed to drop at least one gold coin worth 250g. It can sometimes drop more than one gold coin: the game rolls a chance for one extra gold coin to be dropped. That chance starts at 1%, climbs by 0.8% for each month that has passed in this save file, and caps at 6.5%. The roll is repeated as long as it is successful. Luck does not affect odds of encountering Gold Slimes, nor does it affect the odds of them dropping extra gold coins.[8]
Color-Based Drops
In addition to the drops list above, the color of each variation is random and may have additional drops depending on the color range chosen. [3]
Color groups are mutually exclusive and listed in the order the game tests for them. (For example, a slime may fall into the White and Gray categories, but White is tested for first, so the slime would drop Iron Ore and not Stone).
The background color of the "RGB Values" column in the table below shows the color range that a slime can be to receive the drop.
Color RGB Values Drops
Brown Red > 49 and < 101, Green > 24 and < 51, Blue < 26 Wood ((3-6) 100%), Hardwood (10%)
Black Red < 80, Green < 80, Blue < 80 Coal (100%), Neptunite (5%), Bixite (5%)
Yellow Red > 200, Green > 180, Blue < 50
Gold Ore (100%)
Red Red > 220, Green > 90 and < 150, Blue < 50
Copper Ore (100%)
White Red > 230, Green > 230, Blue > 230 Refined Quartz (one if the red value is even, a second if the green value is also even), Iron Ore (if refined quartz was not dropped), Diamond (100% if all red, green, and blue values are even numbers OR if red, green and blue values are all 255)
Gray Red > 150, Green > 150, Blue > 150
Stone (100%)
Purple Red > 150, Green < 50, Blue > 180
Iridium Ore ((x2) 25% first generation, 50% subsequent generations)
Quests
Marlon may request the player to slay 10 Purple Slimes in the "Monster Hunt" quest during the Desert Festival.
