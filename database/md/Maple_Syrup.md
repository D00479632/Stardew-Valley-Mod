**Maple Syrup** is Tree sap made from the Tapper when it is placed on a Maple Tree, taking 9 days, or 4 days with a Heavy Tapper.

Maple Syrup can be obtained by tapping Maple Trees grown by the player or growing naturally in Stardew Valley (*e.g.,* in Cindersap Forest). It can also rarely be obtained after processing Hardwood in a Wood Chipper.

Although Maple Syrup is labeled "Artisan Good" in-game, it does not benefit from the Artisan Profession, but instead from the Tapper Profession (+25% sell price).
