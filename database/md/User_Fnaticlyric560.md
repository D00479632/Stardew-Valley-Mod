From Stardew Valley Wiki

Heyo.

Im Fanaticlyric560, and I am here to correct typos or grammatical errors, or do my part keeping the wiki up to date wherever I can. I am familiar with Mediawiki syntax and Javascript, which I have found to be helpful on the wiki.

A tip from a lesson I learned long ago: new editors, please read the help:editing guide to figure out what to do BEFORE you edit.

You can also find me on Wikipedia here: \[\[1]] And you can find me on Mediawiki here: \[\[2]] And if you care, you can find me here on Twitch: \[\[3]] Thank you!
