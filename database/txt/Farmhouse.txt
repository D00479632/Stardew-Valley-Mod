Farmhouse
Closed: Never
Address: The Farm
The Farmhouse is the player's permanent residence in Stardew Valley. Initially, it has only one small room that contains a single bed, a fireplace, an old TV (either a Budget TV or Floor TV), various decorations depending on what farm style was chosen, and a floor mat of varying design, which can all be changed and expanded later on. The outer footprint of the farmhouse is a 9×5 rectangle. The fireplace can be moved by left-clicking or turned on by right-clicking on it.
Flooring and Wallpaper can be changed using patterns bought from Pierre's or JojaMart, or fetched from a Catalogue. New furniture (including fireplaces) can be added at any time.
Upgrades can be purchased at the Carpenter's Shop. Each new room added when upgrading can have its own flooring and wallpaper patterns. You can also change the color of the exterior at the Carpenter's Shop.
Upon getting married or having Krobus move in as a roommate, the game automatically adds an extra room that is based on that character's style.

Achievements
There are 2 Achievements related to completing Farmhouse upgrades.
Moving Up (Upgrade the house one time)
Living Large (Upgrade the house two times)
Note that there are no achievements for upgrading the farmhouse the third time (which adds the cellar) or for purchasing any renovations.
Notes
The magnifying glass icon over the woodpile at the left of the farmhouse is related to "The Mysterious Qi" Quest.
Instead of gathering 450 wood for the Farmhouse Upgrade 1, it can all be purchased at the Carpenter's Shop during year 1 for 4,500g, or during year 2+ for 22,500g. The total cost for the upgrade would then be 14,500g in year 1, or 32,500g in year 2+.
The kitchen sink can be used to refill the player's watering can.
