From Stardew Valley Wiki

Hi. I'm Butterbur.

On 29 Mar 2021, I returned from an unplanned and unavoidable three-month absence to find that the whole wiki had been retired and supplanted by a new one.

Reassessing the situation, I decided that I wanted by older contributions to be directly available to me through the login, so I have re-activated my old account. But I also reassessed how I'd been playing Stardew and decided I wanted to take a fresh approach. This login name just didn't suit the new direction, so I chose another name and created a new account: Giles. You can find me there. I'll only be touching here occasionally and unpredictably, as I feel the need or wish to do so.
