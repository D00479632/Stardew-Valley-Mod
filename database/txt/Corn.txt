Multi-Seasonal Crop
Corn may be planted in both Summer and Fall. There is no difference in its behavior in either season.
If a Corn plant (of any growth stage) is in the ground on the 28th of Summer, it will continue growing on the 1st of Fall as though nothing had changed. Fertilizer in the ground underneath a Corn plant on Summer 28 will not disappear on Fall 1.

Tailoring
Corn is used in the spool of the Sewing Machine with Cloth in the feed to create a dyeable Striped Shirt. It is a yellow dye when used in the spool of the Sewing Machine with a dyeable clothing item in the feed. It can be placed in the yellow dye pot at Emily's and Haley's house, 2 Willow Lane for use in dyeing.
Quests
Corn may be randomly requested in Fall at the "Help Wanted" board outside Pierre's General Store for a reward of 150g and 150 Friendship points.
Trivia
Normal quality Corn sells for 50g, but 2 packets of Corn Seeds sell for a total of 150g. This is the same sell price as corn pickles (assuming no Artisan Profession), but instead of 4000 minutes in a Preserves Jar, it takes 20 minutes in a Seed Maker.
