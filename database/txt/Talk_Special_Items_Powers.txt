And Wallet
Just a question, but any change is better done now than later. Special Items and Powers is not really a new topic, but rather a large expansion of a previous topic. I'm not sure why a new article was created for the topic. Would it not be better to rename the whole Wallet article to the new title, and redirect "Wallet" to Special Items & Powers? The Wiki then would retain all older edits to information regarding the older items, including History. My thought is for the Wiki's support of players who continue to use older software versions.
