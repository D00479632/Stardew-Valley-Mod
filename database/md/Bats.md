## Attacks

Bats are a flying enemy that will come at the character from any direction. It will fly towards them, sometimes directly and sometimes at an angle to surround and attack from a different position!

Bats have 3 methods of appearing:

- They can be regular enemies on the floor - their wings are folded and they are hanging from the ceiling. Approaching them makes them active, and they will attack the player from this point on.
- They can appear at random. The character will hear a bat screech and one will approach from a random direction from outside the floor.
- On some floors a colored fog will appear over the area. Multiple bats will start attacking from various directions.

## Strategy

Since bats may appear from different directions, simultaneously to one another and other monsters, they can get dangerous especially early game. The best weapon against bats is a regular sword swing (not a club or dagger), since its angle is large. Finding the right timing is easy for a single bat, but might be tricker for multiple fliers. One strategy is to move in a contrary direction to the bats so they are all on one side, and swing at them all at once.

## Trivia

- Starting at and below floor 880 in the Skull Cavern on non-Prehistoric floors, Iridium Bats will be colored red and have double health and greatly increased speed.\[5]
