**Ancient Seeds** are a type of seed. Mature plants yield Ancient Fruit. After donating an Ancient Seed artifact to the Museum, a packet of Ancient Seeds can be claimed from Gunther as a reward. A crafting recipe will also be given which allows Ancient Seeds to be crafted from an Ancient Seed artifact.

They can also be obtained from Ancient Fruit by using a Seed Maker. Whenever the Seed Maker is used with any crop other than Ancient Fruit, there is a 0.5% chance to obtain one packet of Ancient Seeds instead of the crop's seeds.

Ancient Seeds cannot be planted in Garden Pots. Attempting to place Ancient Seeds in a Garden Pot will display the message "Her roots grow very deep... She wouldn't be happy in there."

Ancient Seeds **can** be planted in the Greenhouse.

Ancient Seeds can be deconstructed to make an Ancient Seed artifact using a Deconstructor. This is useful if the player has a packet of Ancient Seeds available but does not yet have the artifact donated to the Museum.
