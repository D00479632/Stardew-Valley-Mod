Ingredients
Gold Bar (2)
The Treasure Hunter is a tackle that helps fishing by preventing fish from escaping while collecting treasure chests and by increasing the chance to find treasure chests by 5% (10% if the player is using an Advanced Iridium Rod with 2 Treasure Hunters). It can be crafted or purchased from Willy's Fish Shop for 750g after reaching Fishing level 7. It may also randomly appear at the Traveling Cart for 750–1,250g.
Only the Iridium Rod or the Advanced Iridium Rod can equip tackle. The Iridium Rod can only attach one tackle at a time, while the Advanced Iridium Rod can attach two. To attach tackle, left-click on the tackle, then right-click on the rod. To remove tackle, first right-click to remove any bait, then right-click to remove the tackle. For an Advanced Iridium Rod, the left tackle will be the first one removed.
Tackle does not stack in inventory or chests; each tackle takes up one inventory slot.
