Ingredients
Wool (1)
Cloth is an Artisan Good made from the Loom using Wool, taking 4 hours. Occasionally the Traveling Cart will offer it in her rotating stock. It can also be made by recycling a Soggy Newspaper using the Recycling Machine, or dropped from Mummies when slain. Emily may occasionally send you a Cloth in the mail. She also sells a set of five Cloth at her shop at the Desert Festival for 25 Calico Eggs. The Desert Trader will trade three Aquamarines for one cloth on Wednesdays.
Placing quality Wool into a Loom gives a chance to produce 2 Cloth. Silver gives a 10% chance, gold gives a 50% chance, and iridium gives a 100% chance.
