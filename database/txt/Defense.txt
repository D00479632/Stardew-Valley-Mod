Defense is a statistic that affects how much damage the player takes. Defense can be increased by food and equipment, or decreased by debuffs.
Each point of total Defense reduces damage taken by 1 point, to a minimum of 1 damage per hit. For example, a Green Slime normally deals between 4 and 6 damage. If Sneakers are equipped, providing 1 Defense, it deals between 3 and 5 damage instead. On the other hand, if Space Boots are equipped, providing 4 Defense, a Green Slime deals 1 damage 66% of the time and 2 damage 33% of the time. Negative Defense increases damage taken. For example, the Shadow Shaman Jinxed effect causes damage from each hit to be increased by 8.
