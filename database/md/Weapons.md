From Stardew Valley Wiki

**Weapons** are used to deal damage and fight monsters. Weapons are quite unlike other tools, as firstly they do not cost energy to use, and secondly they are not upgraded at the Blacksmith. Instead, most weapons can be found as monster drops, purchased from the Adventurer's Guild, or found in chests in the Mines. Most weapons (except the slingshots) can also be sold to the Adventurer's Guild.

Most weapons have a secondary (special) attack, executed by right-clicking. With the sword, you will block some damage or knock back flying enemies. A club will smash the ground, knocking back nearby enemies and causing minor damage. With a dagger, you will perform a series of quick stabs.

While not designed for combat, the Axe, Pickaxe, and Scythe can be used as weapons to inflict a small amount of damage. The Axe and Pickaxe consume energy, while the Scythe does not.

## Weapon Stats

Image Name Description

Speed Speed is separate from player speed. This speed only influences Attack Frequency. The displayed speed is applied as a modifier to the weapon's base speed, which varies by weapon type.

Defense Defense is a statistic that affects how much damage the player takes.

Weight The Weight of a weapon affects how far an enemy will be knocked back.

Crit. Chance The Crit. Chance of a weapon affects the likelihood to perform a critical strike with increased damage.

Crit. Power When you hit a critical strike, this statistic will add additional damage to your enemy.

## Sword

Swords are well-rounded weapons with quick attacks and low swing delay. Their secondary attack puts you into a blocking stance, negating damage and dealing minor damage to the enemy that attacked you. Blocking also knocks back flying enemies.

## Dagger

Daggers are the fastest-attacking weapons in the game. Their range is short, however, and they only target the square in front of the player rather than swinging in an arc like a sword. Using their secondary attack causes the player to stab 4 times in quick succession. During the secondary attack, the enemy will be locked in place.

## Club

Clubs are heavy weapons that tend to be slower than swords and daggers but with a wide swing. Their secondary attack causes the player to slam the ground in front of them, causing an area-of-effect attack in a radius around the player that has strong knockback. Damage dealt by this attack will never be a critical hit.\[1]

Right-clicking with a Club and immediately left-clicking repeatedly will cause multiple attacks to occur in quick succession.

## Slingshot

The damage dealt by a slingshot depends mainly on the ammunition used. A Master Slingshot will generally deal 2x the damage of a regular Slingshot using the same ammo.

Master Slingshot Requires stones for ammo. Depends on ammo used .02 The Mines (Floor 70 chest reward) data-sort-value="1000"&gt;1,000g N/A

### Slingshot Ammunition

To equip a slingshot with ammunition, select the ammunition, then Right-Click on the slingshot.

The type of ammunition used determines the damage dealt, according to the following formulas:\[2]

**Slingshot:**

`Damage = AmmoMultiplier + random number between [-(AmmoMultiplier / 2), AmmoMultiplier + 1]`

**Master Slingshot:**

`Damage = 2 * (AmmoMultiplier + random number between [-(AmmoMultiplier / 2), AmmoMultiplier + 1])`

With the worst ammo (*i.e.,* Fruits, Vegetables, or Eggs), a Slingshot can deal 1-3 and a Master Slingshot can deal 2-6 damage. With the best ammo, Iridium Ore and a Slingshot can deal 25-101 damage while a Master Slingshot can deal 50-202 damage.

The following items can be used as ammunition:

Item AmmoMultiplier Slingshot Damage Master Slingshot Damage All Fruits • All Vegetables • All Eggs 1 1-3 2-6 Coal 15 8-31 16-62 Copper Ore 10 5-21 10-42 Explosive Ammo 20 10-41 20-82 Gold Ore 30 15-61 30-122 Iridium Ore 50 25-101 50-202 Iron Ore 20 10-41 20-82 Stone 5 3-11 6-22 Wood 2 1-5 2-10

## Weapon Level and Sell Price

Weapon level is based on weapon points (rounded down): `weaponpoints / 7 + 1`. Weapon points are calculated using several statistics of the weapon, such as average damage, speed, type, added defense &amp; precision, crit. chance and crit. multiplier.

Weapon points (rounded down) = `average weapon damage (rounded down) x (1 + 0.03 x speed{min 0; 15 if dagger}) + (precision / 2 + defense) + ((crit.chance -0.02) x 200) + ((crit multiplier - 3) x 6) + 20{if darksword, else 0} + (defense x 2)`\[3]

Here is an example applying the formula to calculate the level of the Iridium Needle: `(27 x (1 + 0.03 x 15) + 0 / 2 + 0 + ((0.10 - 0.02) x 200) + (7 - 3) x 6) + 0 + 0) / 7 + 1` (Integer) = **12**

Sell price is calculated as `item level x 100 / 2`.\[4]

## Glitches

- It's possible to clip through to the space around any map area (*e.g.,* the black area around the Farmhouse) by repeatedly swinging a sword or scythe while standing just inside the exit point. Swinging the sword or scythe causes the player to be pushed forward a few pixels, allowing the player to eventually reach the black area.
  
  - To return from the normally unreachable area, simply walk into the exit point.
- It is possible to use a club weapon's secondary attack several times in quick succession by right clicking then mashing left click (or the C key) before the attack animation is over. This can be useful while attacking higher level enemies with a low level weapon.
  
  - Pressing left click too early will result in a normal swing to take place rather than the secondary attack.
  - This glitch will occasionally soft-lock the game, if an additional animation occurs while spamming left-click/C.
- If you block with a sword while interacting with an object at the same time, such as a bush or a villager, you can make your sprite break, showing both the blocking sprite, and facing towards the screen sprite at the same time. You will be stuck like this until you use the block again.
- If you press Right Shift + R + Delete during an attack animation, this will cancel the animation. This can be used to attack Monsters faster.

## Trivia

- There is unimplemented game code allowing the player to receive a "Battered Sword" through the mail as a reward for an unknown event. This sword could be upgraded (by unknown means) 4 times, changing it into a "Hero's Sword", "Holy Sword", "Dark Sword", and finally "Galaxy Sword."
- Hitting an NPC with a slingshot reduces friendship with them by 30 points, and results in them saying either "Ow! I can't believe you would do that to me!" or "That hurt! What's your problem?" if you talk to them.
