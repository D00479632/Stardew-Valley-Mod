## List of Blessings

Every day, the Statue will grant a random blessing to the player from the list below. All blessings except for the Blessing Of The Butterfly and the Blessing Of Waters lasts for the duration of the in-game day.

Although the blessing the player will receive on a given day is random, it is pre-determined at the start of the day. Therefore there is no benefit to crafting multiple statues or restarting the day as the player will just receive the same blessing.

### Blessing Of The Butterfly

The Blessing of the Butterfly spawns a Prismatic Butterfly somewhere in the valley (specifically in one of Cindersap Forest, Pelican Town, the Beach, the Mountain, the Secret Woods, Bus Stop, or Backwoods). The butterfly randomly moves in a wide area around where it spawns, so it's possible that a Prismatic Butterfly in an unreachable location will move somewhere that the player can reach. Once the player finds it, the butterfly provides an amount of gold equal to 0.5% of the player's total earnings so far. However, the amount of gold earned cannot be less than data-sort-value="100"&gt;100g and cannot be greater than data-sort-value="50000"&gt;50,000g. There's a chance (equal to approximately `0.05 + Daily Luck`) that it will also drop a Prismatic Shard.\[1]

The Blessing of the Butterfly cannot be given in rainy weather or on festival days.

The Prismatic Butterfly cannot spawn after 5 pm. This means that if it has reached 5 pm, the player has not found the butterfly yet, and they are not on the map where the butterfly is, they will be unable to find it. The Prismatic Butterfly disappears at the end of the day if it is not found.

In Multiplayer, each player can get the blessing. They each get their own separate butterfly to find in different locations.

### Blessing Of Energy

When this blessing is active, players cannot lose energy by any means. If the player receives this blessing when their energy is not full, their energy will remain what it was before.

### Blessing of Fangs

When this blessing is active, an additive 10% crit is granted. This is added before calculations from Scout Profession.\[2]

### Blessing Of Friendship

When this blessing is active, talking to people will give the player 60 friendship points, rather than the usual 20. This means that talking to a villager when the blessing is active will give three days' worth of talking friendship points in one day. This is roughly equivalent to giving a gold quality liked gift on a day that is not their birthday.

### Blessing Of Speed

When this blessing is active, the player receives a +0.5 Speed buff. This stacks with all other Speed buffs.

### Blessing Of Waters

When this blessing is active, the difficulty of Legendary fish decreases by 25% and the difficulty of non-Legendary fish (with the exception of Carp) decreases by 50%. In addition, for all fish, the progress bar decreases 50% slower. This stacks multiplicatively with the Trap Bobber for a total of a 67% decrease with one Trap Bobber equipped and 75% with two.\[3]

Catching anything that is not considered a fish (such as Algae, Jelly, Seaweed, and Trash) does not count towards the blessing. But any fish hooked will count as part of the blessing even if the player lets the fish escape. If multiple fish are caught at once with the use of Challenge Bait or Wild Bait, it only counts as one fish for the blessing.

### Blessing Of Luck

When this blessing is active, the player receives a +1 Luck buff. This stacks with all other Luck buffs.

## Bugs

- Occasionally, the Prismatic Butterfly will spawn in an area of the map that is unreachable by the player (*e.g.* the ocean).
