## Behavior

They exist in a variety of different lengths, but each is larger than the normal serpent. They inflict damage if any part of their body touches the player. They also take damage if hit by the player on any part of their body.

## Health

A Royal Serpent's health is based on its tail length. Each segment of tail increases HP by 50. The minimum number of tail segments is 3, and the maximum is 18. \[2]
