The **Qi Bean** is a seed found throughout Stardew Valley and on Ginger Island during the quest Qi's Crop. Mature plants yield Qi Fruit.

All Qi Fruit and Qi Beans despawn when the quest is over (*i.e.,* the day after the player ships them or the quest timer ends), including growing crops, all players' inventories, Chests, Preserves Jars, Kegs, and Marlon's Item Recovery Service list. Giant Qi Fruit would not disappear.

## Dyeing

The Qi Bean can be used in dyeing, serving as a blue dye at the dye pots, located in Emily's and Haley's house, 2 Willow Lane.

## Tips

- Given that Fishing Treasure Chests have a 43% chance (51% chance for Golden Fishing Treasure Chests) to yield at least one stack of up to 4 Qi Beans during the quest, fishing is a reliable source of Qi Beans when combined with the Magnet bait, Pirate Profession, and a Treasure Hunter tackle.
- Putting Qi Fruit into Seed Makers and planting the resulting Qi Beans will, on average, nearly double the Qi Fruit supply. Qi Fruit produced early in the quest can be doubled several times with this method.
- The use of Speed-Gro, Deluxe Speed-Gro, or Hyper Speed-Gro, and the Agriculturist Profession can reduce the time between harvests by 1 or 2 days.
- Qi Beans can also be amassed quickly using Treasure Totems. During the quest, Artifact Spots have a 25% chance to drop 2-5 Qi Beans, so each Treasure Totem will produce 14 Qi Beans on average, assuming no obstacle blocks any of the 16 tiles.
