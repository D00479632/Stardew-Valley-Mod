The **Banana Sapling** is a Fruit Tree sapling that takes 28 days to grow into a Banana Tree, after which it will produce one fruit each day during the Summer, or year-round on Ginger Island. Like all Fruit Trees, it will also produce fruit all year round if planted in the Greenhouse.

It can be purchased from the Island Trader in exchange for 5 Dragon Teeth. Banana Saplings can sometimes be found by breaking open a Golden Coconut. Professor Snail also gives a Banana Sapling as a reward for completing the Large Animal collection in the Island Field Office. One can be purchased from Leo's shop during the Desert Festival for data-sort-value="100"&gt; 100 Calico Eggs.
