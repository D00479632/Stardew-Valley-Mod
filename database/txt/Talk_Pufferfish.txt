Island
Looks like these can also be caught in the Pirate's Cove in 1.5 - I caught one in Spring. Does anybody have any more details about this that we could add to the page? --StupidDroid (talk) 00:19, 5 March 2021 (UTC)
Based on Locations.xnb, it can be caught during any season on Ginger Island -- in the South, West, Southeast, and Pirate's Cove. Looks like the time and weather are the same as for the valley in summer, 12pm to 4pm, sunny weather only. margotbean (talk) 19:09, 5 March 2021 (UTC)
