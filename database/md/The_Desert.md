**The Calico Desert** is an exterior map region located far to the northwest of Pelican Town. The weather here is always sunny and the seasons are all the same.

The desert is inaccessible until the Bus at the Bus Stop has been repaired by completing the Vault Bundles at the Community Center or by purchasing "Bus Repair" for data-sort-value="40000"&gt;40,000g from the Joja Community Development Form. The Desert Festival is held annually from Spring 15th to 17th.

## Features

Image Name Description

Skull Cavern The entrance to Skull Cavern is located in the northwest corner of the Desert. The Skull Key can be used to open the door inside the cavern.

Oasis The Oasis is a store located in the southwest section of the area. It is run by Sandy and sells a number of seeds not available in Pelican Town, along with an additional item that depends on the day of the week.

- The Casino is accessible through the Oasis once "The Mysterious Qi" quest is completed.

Desert Trader The Desert Trader's tent is located in the east of the map.

Three Pillars Three pillars are found in the northeast part of the Desert; this location is tied to one of the game's Secrets.

Warp Statue The player can warp to the desert using a Warp Totem: Desert or a Desert Obelisk. Both methods warp the player to the same warp statue, located south of the Desert Trader. The Bus also appears in the Desert whenever the player warps, allowing the player to ride back in the bus as usual.

Sand Dragon On top of a hill located directly north of the Oasis, are the large bones of a sand dragon. While standing near the skull of the creature, it can be interacted with, resulting in text that says: "Its maw gapes at the desert sun. Even in death, it yearns for a taste." It is related to the Mr. Qi questline; note that this feature is not available on Spring 15-17 due to the Desert Festival.

## Foraging

Locations in the Desert where forageable items can spawn.

The same forageable items are found in the Desert year-round:\[1]

- Coconut (50%) and Cactus Fruit (50%)

Forageable items spawn at an average rate of 2.0 per night year-round.\[2] The map shows the possible locations as red and magenta tiles; when the original trees are present, the magenta tiles have a 90% smaller chance of spawning items because they are identified as being behind the original trees.

The original trees found in the Desert are all Palm Trees. They can be chopped down. They do not drop seeds, but may occasionally drop a Coconut when chopped down or shaken. They cannot be tapped.

In addition, regular trees (Maple, Oak, Pine, and Mahogany) can all be planted throughout the Desert. Unlike in the main valley, trees planed in the Oasis will grow during Winter even without Tree Fertilizer.

## Artifacts

Artifacts that can be found by digging up Artifact Spots in the Desert are:

- Palm Fossil (7%)
- Golden Relic (6%)
- Golden Mask (3%)

Other possible items are:

- 1-3 Clay (48%)
- Lost Book (20%); once all Lost Books have been found, any potential Lost Book is replaced by Mixed Seeds.
- 1-3 Stone (16%)
- An unseen Secret Note: up to 4% chance, only if the player has a Magnifying Glass.

Note that Snow Yams, Winter Roots, and Rice Shoots are never found in the Desert.

Artifact spots spawn at an average rate of 1.0 per night, except in winter when the average rate increases to 1.4 per night.\[3]

## Fishing

Fishing Zones at the Desert Pond.

The primary location for fishing in the Desert is the pond in the northwest section. The player can catch two unique fish here, namely the Sandfish and Scorpion Carp. The Sandfish is needed for the Specialty Fish Bundle in the Fish Tank.

It's also possible to fish in the pool of water on the southern edge of the map, if the player's Fishing skill is high enough for the bobber to reach the water. However, the fish quality will always be minimal in the southern pond, as the Fishing Zone is 0 for the entire pond. \[4] The Pyramid Decal can be fished here (10% chance).
