The **Jack-O-Lantern** is a craftable decorative lighting item that can be held or placed to provide light. It can be purchased from Pierre's booth at the Spirit's Eve festival for data-sort-value="750"&gt;750g. You can also buy the recipe from the booth for data-sort-value="2000"&gt;2,000g.

The Jack-O-Lantern influences a radius of approximately 1 tile with dim lighting. It can be placed indoors or outdoors, or in places like the Mines. It can be removed by striking it with a Hoe, a Pickaxe, or an Axe. Unlike the braziers, which can toggle on and off, the Jack-O-Lantern is always on. They provide the least light out of all craftable lighting sources.

On the 17th of Fall, after the Stardew Valley Fair, Jack-o-Lanterns appear in front of the following locations: 1 Willow Lane (Jodi, Kent, Sam, and Vincent), 2 Willow Lane (Haley and Emily), 1 River Road (Evelyn George, and Alex), Carpenter's Shop (Robin, Demetrius, Maru, and Sebastian), and the Trailer (Pam and Penny).

On the 1st of Winter, the Jack-O-Lantern turns into a Rotten Plant (unless stored in a chest or inventory).
