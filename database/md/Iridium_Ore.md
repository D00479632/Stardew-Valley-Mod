## Locations

- Mining Iridium Nodes and Mystic Stones.
  
  - Iridium Nodes can be found in the Quarry, Skull Cavern, and Volcano Dungeon. They can also spawn on Hill-top and Four Corners farm maps at Mining Skill level 10.  
    Tips: The chance to find Iridium Ore increases steadily the further one descends into the Skull Cavern. Large amounts of staircases or bombs can get one deep into the Skull Cavern quickly.
  - Mystic Stones can be found in the Mines (Floor 100+), Quarry, Skull Cavern and Volcano Dungeon.
- Opening Magma Geodes, Omni Geodes, and Golden Coconuts.
  
  - To further enhance geode frequency, choose the Geologist Profession at Mining Level 5 and the Excavator Profession at Mining Level 10.
  - Krobus sells 1 Omni Geode every Tuesday for data-sort-value="300"&gt;300g each, and the Oasis sells 3 Omni Geodes every Wednesday for data-sort-value="500"&gt;500g each.
  - The Oasis sells 10 Coconuts every Monday for data-sort-value="400"&gt;400g each, which can then be traded with the Island Trader for 1 Golden Coconut after having cracked at least one Golden Coconut.
- Rare drop from high level Monsters.
  
  - Purple Slimes in the Skull Cavern have a chance to drop both Iridium Ore and Iridium Bars. They can be raised in Slime Hutches.
  - Iridium Bats in the Skull Cavern may drop an Iridium Bar (0.8% chance) and up to 4 Iridium Ore when slain.
  - Iridium Crabs in the Skull Cavern may drop up to 3 Iridium Ore when slain.

- Breaking crates and barrels in the dangerous Mines and Volcano Dungeon.
- Catching regular and golden Fishing Treasure Chests.
- A Super Cucumber Fish Pond may produce 1-3 Iridium Ore when the population of the pond reaches 9.
- Panning in any area.
- A fallen meteorite on the Farm will drop 10 Iridium Ore when mined.
