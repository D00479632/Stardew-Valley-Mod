Mixed Flower Seeds are seeds capable of producing a specific set of crops (listed below). The specific crop that grows from one Mixed Flower Seed is randomly chosen when it is planted. The choice is normally limited to crops of the current season, even indoors in the Greenhouse and in the Garden Pot. Mixed Flower Seeds cannot be planted outside in winter. If they are planted indoors in winter, then the type of crop is randomly chosen from crops of all seasons. Mixed Flower Seeds planted on Ginger Island will always produce summer crops.
