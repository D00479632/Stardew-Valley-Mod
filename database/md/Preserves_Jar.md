The **Preserves Jar** is a type of Artisan Equipment used to make Artisan Goods. Fruit makes Jelly; Mushrooms, Vegetables, and foraged items make Pickles; Sturgeon Roe makes Caviar; and other fish Roe make their respective Aged Roe.

A Preserves Jar is the reward for completing the Quality Crops Bundle in the Pantry **or** the Rare Crops Bundle in the Pantry (Remixed).

4 Preserves Jars can be obtained as the seventh prize from the Prize Machine in the Mayor's Manor (33% chance).

## Products

Quality of ingredients makes no difference to the finished product. The value of the finished product is determined using the base value (*i.e.,* with no silver or gold star) of the item. However, the preserved version is always at least as profitable as even gold star produce, although the profit margin is lower compared to normal produce.

Note that processing times are approximate, since time passes differently from 2am to 6am. One hour = 60 minutes from 6am to 2am, but 1 hour = 100 minutes from 2am to 6am. One full day is 1600 minutes, where day is 1200 minutes and night is 400 minutes.

**Notes**

- Items that have a 4000m processing time starting at 6:00am are done at 7:20pm two days later. Items starting between 12:40pm and 7:20pm are done at 6:00am three days later.
- If Caviar processing is started at 6am it finishes at 2am three days later, making it impossible to collect that day. It is ready four days later at the start of the day if processing begins before 12:40 pm. If it were to be started at 1:50am (the latest time it could be started), it would be finished at 7:10pm four days later.
- Truffles are not classified as Mushrooms and therefore cannot be placed into the Preserves Jar.
- Pickles made from an inedible vegetable will instead give 0.625 × Base Vegetable Price and 0.28125 × Base Vegetable Price.\[2]
- Jelly made from an inedible fruit will instead give 0.5 × Base Fruit Price and 0.225 × Base Fruit Price.\[3]
- The following foraged items can be pickled: Wild Horseradish, Leek, Dandelion, Cave Carrot, Morel, Chanterelle, Spring Onion, Common Mushroom, Hazelnut, Winter Root, Snow Yam, Purple Mushroom, Ginger, and Magma Cap.

## Preserves Jar vs. Keg

*See also: Preserves Jar Productivity, Keg Productivity*

The Preserves Jar increases the profit of a crop using the following equation: (2 × Base Crop Value + 50); while the Keg multiplies the base value of Fruits by 3, and Vegetables by 2.25. Because of this, low-value, high-yield crops like Corn or Tomatoes are more valuable in the preserves jar. The keg, on the other hand, favors crops with a much higher base value, such as Ancient Fruit or Melons. The breakpoint is data-sort-value="50"&gt;50g for fruits and data-sort-value="200"&gt;200g for vegetables.

Below is a list of crops that are more beneficial to be put in the preserves jar, along with their raw base sell price.

Vegetables Fruits

- Amaranth (150g)
- Artichoke (160g)
- Beet (100g)
- Bok Choy (80g)
- Broccoli (70g)
- Carrot (35g)
- Cauliflower (175g)
- Corn (50g)
- Eggplant (60g)
- Fiddlehead Fern (90g)
- Garlic (60g)
- Green Bean (40g)
- Kale (110g)
- Parsnip (35g)
- Potato (80g)
- Radish (90g)
- Summer Squash (45g)
- Taro Root (100g)
- Tea Leaves (50g)
- Tomato (60g)
- Unmilled Rice (30g)
- Yam (160g)

<!--THE END-->

- Apricot (50g)*
- Blackberry (20g)
- Blueberry (50g)*
- Hot Pepper (40g)
- Qi Fruit (1g)
- Salmonberry (5g)

\**Wine and jelly each sell for data-sort-value="150"&gt;150g, but jelly processes faster than wine.*

It should be noted that these calculations only involve the value gained in terms of max profit; if looking at profit per day based on the time required, the preserves jar outpaces the keg regardless of the base value of the item (in *every* case except for Hops and Wheat) since the preserves jar has a much faster processing time.

## Storage Options

*See also: Keg storage options, Crafted goods outside the farm*

While Preserves Jars can be stored anywhere on the farm, it is more space efficient to store them inside farm buildings or outside the farm altogether.

## Trivia

- The description of the Preserves Jar states that it makes Jam, but it actually produces Jelly.
- The description of the Preserves Jar was not updated to include fish roe or caviar in v1.4.
