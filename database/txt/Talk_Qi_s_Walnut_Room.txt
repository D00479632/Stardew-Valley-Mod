Junimo Chests
Are you sure you need to leave the map and come back (vs, say, just re-opening the store) to purchase more junimo chests? As far as I know that's not a mechanic. Atravita (talk) 19:47, 22 September 2023 (UTC)
No idea, can test later. Giles? Any idea? margotbean (talk) 19:53, 22 September 2023 (UTC)
Fortunately I have a perfect test save, and all that's required is to close and re-open the shop interface. Page edited to reflect. margotbean (talk) 21:36, 22 September 2023 (UTC)
Being able to purchase Pierre's Missing Stocklist twice
In Mr. Qi's Walnut Room, which you can enter after collecting 100 Golden Walnuts on Ginger Island, there are a bunch of rewards you can buy with Qi Gems and a Perfection Tracker, where if you have 100% completion, you can collect a bunch of end-game rewards, such as Golden Chickens, Golden Eggs, the Statue Of True Perfection, etc. The item I'm talking about here is Pierre's Missing Stocklist. You can purchase this item for 50 Qi Gems, what it does is if you give it to Pierre, Pierre will sell every Seed that he can sell, with Out of Season Seeds costing 50% more. If you tried giving this item to a different Villager, a box will show up saying "Villager looks puzzled..." For some reason if you buy this Stocklist, give it to Pierre, then go to sleep, then enter the Walnut Room again, you can actually purchase this Stocklist again, but giving it to Pierre will not give it to Pierre, but instead will say "Pierre looks puzzled..." upon tying to give it to him. This is incredibly odd... 9000 (talk) 04:44, 9 February 2024 (UTC)
Qi's Cuisine Strategies
The strategies listed work for people who are willing to spend a great deal, but aren't very useful for people who are looking to use up stock (or who don't want to use keg space and/or Making 500 Eggplant Parmesan, for example (200g each) requires only 500 eggplant and 500 tomatoes. As those are both continually-producing crops, it's very easy to have a large stockpile of produce available for this. Fewer total ingredients are required, as well. It also only requires 200 seeds, as eggplant and tomato plants both produce five items per plot (if planted on the first day of their respective seasons). To me, that feels more approachable than planting and harvesting 1667 wheat Idk, I'm new enough that I'm not sure if I should just edit the page directly or not. Abac (talk) 00:38, 27 June 2024 (UTC)
Oh, why not? Go for it! Just use as few words as possible. Example: "Another option for those who plan ahead is to stockpile 500 eggplant and 500 tomatoes and cook 500 Eggplant Parmesan. This requires 100 Eggplant Seeds and 100 Tomato Seeds, planted on the first day of their season."
Simple and effective. I just might use that strategy myself! margotbean (talk) 06:59, 27 June 2024 (UTC)
