The Clam is a fish that can be caught using a Crab Pot in any saltwater body of water. It can also be foraged from The Beach, gifted by a pet turtle with max friendship, or randomly found at the Traveling Cart for 150–1,000g. One Clam can sometimes be purchased for 500g from Pierre's booth at the Feast of the Winter Star. It may also be found foraging on levels 1-29 of the Mines while the Shrine of Challenge is enabled, or the Danger in The Deep quest is active. Like all fish caught from the crab pot, it cannot be eaten unless it is used in a Cooking recipe or smoked.
