## Animal Care

I can see that you did a lot of work on the animal care sections. Very nice!

Now I'm afraid comes the harsh editing part. The wiki is an objective encyclopedia of the game, and the writing on it should be just the facts. Present the facts and let the reader decide what to to with them, rather than giving advice.

Read Help:Editing#Content protocols first, and then edit your text accordingly.

On each animal's page, the section should also start with `{{Main article|Animals#Animal Care}}`.

Also remember to spellcheck, as there are a few typos on the page.

Good luck, and I hope this helps! margotbean (talk) 16:05, 29 April 2023 (UTC)

Will do! I apologize for not being online, I had a school trip, and a lot more going on. I will try to be more consistant... and spell better. Thank you! Mortician Technician (talk) 17:12, 9 May 2023 (UTC)
