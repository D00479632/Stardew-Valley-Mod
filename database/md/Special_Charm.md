Special Charm Information Source Secret Note #20 Sell Price *Cannot be sold*

The **Special Charm** permanently increases daily luck by 0.025. It affects the luck of the current day as soon as it is obtained. It is not necessary to wait until the next day for it to take effect.

It can be obtained after finding and reading Secret Note #20. To solve the puzzle depicted in Secret Note #20, click below.

**Solution**Â  Follow the path depicted in the note. Start at the circle in the center of Pelican Town, and follow each directional arrow until the character hits a permanent obstacle. This path will bring them around town, up across the bridge to JojaMart, and ultimately to a truck parked beside JojaMart. Interacting with the truck will allow the player to speak to a truck driver who requests a Rabbit's Foot. If the player has one in their inventory, they can trade it for the Special Charm. (The charm can still be obtained if JojaMart has been abandoned or turned into a Movie Theater.)

Once obtained, the Special Charm can be found in the Player's Menu on the Special Items &amp; Powers tab.
