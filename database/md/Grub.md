**Grubs** are an enemy found in the Mines. 80 cave insects (any type) need to be killed for the Monster Eradication Goal at the Adventurer's Guild.

## Behavior

*Pupating Grub*

Grubs appear in groups and attack on sight. Upon sustaining critical damage, they will flee and attempt to pupate. When pupating, a Grub turns blue-green and is immune to all damage. It will emerge from its blue-green cocoon as a Cave Fly.

## Strategy

Attempt to separate them from their groups to avoid being overrun.

If you find a single grub, simply attack it constantly and chase it down if it tries to escape. They do not charge you like slimes do, making it impossible for them to hit you if you have a weapon with decent knockback.

If you encounter a group of grubs, use a weapon with medium or high knockback to push them all against a wall or into a corner, that way none of them can escape. Just make sure to not let any escape from the corner, as fighting a flying insect and a group of grubs is quite dangerous, especially if there are a lot of grubs. Explosive ammo from your slingshot also works well.
