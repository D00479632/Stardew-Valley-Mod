Fishing Information Broadcasting Service

“ “Thank you for tuning in to F.I.B.S., the Fishing Information Broadcast Service. Despite our unfortunate name, you can rest assured that we provide only the most trustworthy information about this season's fishing opportunities.”

The **Fishing Information Broadcasting Service** is a TV channel unlocked after reading the letter in the mail sent by Pam the day after the "Potato Juice" cutscene (which triggers after completing "The Strong Stuff" Special Order), which asks if the player has ever tuned in to channel 736. It provides information about the current season's fishing opportunities (including species, time, weather requirement, and location).

## Trivia

- The channel displays information only for fish that can be caught in the river (in Cindersap Forest and Pelican Town), the mountain lake, or the ocean at The Beach. Fish that can be caught during all seasons are not listed.
  
  - Even fish that satisfy these two restrictions for appearing on the channel may not appear on the channel in one of more of its respective seasons. Information for 8 fish is provided during spring, 16 during summer, and 12 during fall and winter.
- Legendary Fish are not listed. The information on how to catch those fish is instead provided in the Lost Book *Secrets of the Legendary Fish*.
- The channel states that Halibut can be caught during 6am-11am during Summer, which is true. However, it can also be caught during nighttime, from 7pm-2am.
