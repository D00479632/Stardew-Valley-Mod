Serpents are an enemy found in the Skull Cavern. 250 Serpents (any type) need to be killed for the Monster Eradication Goal at the Adventurer's Guild.
If the player is Combat Level 10, Serpents can spawn on the Wilderness farm by default. This is true for any farm type if the player has activated the Dark Shrine of Night Terrors or enabled monsters in advanced options when starting a new game. Serpents slain on the Farm will only yield 1/3 of their normal experience points.[2]

Behavior
Serpents will fly at the player at high velocities, dealing a fairly large amount of damage on hit. They are common, meaning that they can easily swarm the player if they do not have a strong enough weapon.
Strategy
Swing early as the hitbox for the enemy is larger than the sprite. Even quicker weapons like the Galaxy Sword can have a trade of hits if swung too late.
Quests
Marlon may request the player to slay 10 Serpents in the "Monster Hunt" quest during the Desert Festival.
