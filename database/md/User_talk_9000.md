## Number of edits today

Hello 9000, and welcome to the wiki! You've made multiple edits today, and most of them seem to be in good faith, but you are creating a bit of chaos. When you create blank pages, or pages with only a spoiler tag, that's considered vandalism. Changes to templates, including creating new ones, requires discussion first, since template changes affect 12 languages.

If you haven't done so, please read Help:Editing for more information. Perhaps you would slow down a bit, and double check the facts you're adding to the wiki, and be sure capitalization and punctuation are correct before saving changes.

I do understand that you probably mean well, and are trying to improve the wiki, and that is appreciated. Read the help page, take a breath, and make sure your edits are good ones, alright? Thanks for your cooperation! margotbean (talk) 21:03, 18 December 2021 (UTC)

I see that you have not heeded my advice, and are still adding incorrect information to the wiki. Please stop, adding incorrect information is of no help to anyone. I don't want to give you a time-out, but continuing these types of edits will unfortunately warrant it.

A good rule for changing established information is to add a code reference. For example, radioactive nodes cannot spawn on mine floors that are a multiple of 5, whether there is an elevator or not. If you have found this to be incorrect, cite the code that controls the behavior.

Please heed my advice this time! margotbean (talk) 22:23, 18 December 2021 (UTC)

Margot, you were supposed to empty your Talk Page at the start of this year, somebody gave out a new topic on your page yesterday, when you empty the page, automatically add the topic in the Archive of 2024. 9000 (talk) 5:54, 3 January 2024 (UTC)

I've been a little preoccupied, but thanks for the reminder! margotbean (talk) 19:45, 3 January 2024 (UTC)

Margot, you were supposed to protect editing from other users on your archived pages, you did that for 2021 and 2022, but not for 2023. You need to change this to lock editing on the archived pages. 9000 (talk) 4:44, 5 January 2024 (UTC)

## Mining Nodes

Thanks for your note. I'm afraid I'm unable to help with that project.

I'd forgotten about the tables on my page. I copied them from the wiki itself some considerable time ago after the entire wiki was moved (rehosted), amidst other changes. For a while, both sites were available for reference. But the tables were "permanently" removed at the new site, for what reasons I cannot remember. I, however, wanted the info, and made a copy onto my own page.

I'm afraid I have no idea how the information was collected then, nor where to look for any changes since its time. I note that there is nothing related to the Volcano Dungeon on Ginger Island, so I suppose everything predates v1.5. I've never looked at the source code, don't have a copy of it, and while I once was a software engineer, I've withdrawn from any such activity since. So, thanks for the offer, but I am content to correct errors that I encounter in play, and to improve the language on the wiki, as things come to my notice. Giles (talk) 21:11, 31 December 2023 (UTC)

That's perfectly fine with us, but it is something missing due to you creating these tables before the release of v1.5. 9000 (talk) 5:52, 1 January 2024 (UTC)

But as I told you, I did not create those tables. I copied them - made a copy for myself, on my talk page. You're free to copy them for yourself, if you wish, so nothing is missing. If you intend to install them back into an article, you will have to take that up with those who removed them in the first place. You might ask Margotbean if she remembers who that was. I don't. Is that peachy keen "perfectly fine"? Giles (talk) 18:35, 2 January 2024 (UTC)

I added that text back because I couldn't think of anything else to say, and I don't know if Margot knows about who made the mining tables. 9000 (talk) 6:02, 3 January 2024 (UTC)

## Shouty caps

Hello 9000! When you comment to an edit in ALL CAPS, IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE YELLING. Can you please stop doing that? Once in a while to get the point across is fine, but every edit? Please reconsider. Thanks, margotbean (talk) 19:59, 11 January 2024 (UTC)

I only did this because I was ANGRY at people not adding periods to a paragraph (e.g. "on a non-rainy day" should be "on a non-rainy day."). This line was from the 14 Heart cutscene, from the Krobus page. And in the Foraging Talk Page, you mentioned that English is not my first language, I only mentioned it because I didn't know that "Wood being worth 50% more" was in the Wiki until now. 9000 (talk) 6:32, 12 January 2024 (UTC)

I have found that it is best not to do any editing at all while one is angry. Anger is not a contribution. Giles (talk) 16:52, 12 January 2024 (UTC)

## Links in Capitals

A link serves to identify the Wiki target, usually an article or section of an article. The name of an article is always capitalized, so when the Wiki follows a link, if the link is capitalized, it is a direct identifier of the target. The Wiki does contain some name redirections, as an aid to Wiki users who may be typing in an article name. Many redirections are uncapitalized article names, which allows the user to type in the uncapitalized form as a convenience. The redirection identifies the true article name so that the target can be located anyway.

If uncapitalized links are used within Wiki text, then a redirection is required in the wiki. That introduces a dependency in the wiki text itself, which makes the wiki less robust. If the redirection were to become corrupted or go missing, the link would no longer work. Moreover, the redirection makes more work for the wiki in order to follow the link, burning server time and resource. If enough of that is going on at any time, it could affect response time.

The best practice therefore is to have redirections available for interactive use, with the intent of limiting that use to interactive cases. Links in wiki text should be directly to the article name (in capitals), to minimize the resources required for its automated uses.

In plain article text, it is not required to use capitals to refer to game items themselves. The game uses capitals for its own purposes, but a strawberry is a Strawberry pretty much all the time, for reading and looking at. The same goes for substitution text created in the link. Its only purpose is for the reader. It's rare to find the need to distinguish a conceptual item from a specific game item, which is all a capital might be good for. Besides, the game names, if different from common-language use, are that way simply in order to make the game intent more specific, as in "Unmilled Rice" (the crop), as opposed to "Rice" (the cooking ingredient). Context in language can sometimes be perfectly clear without the need to be mechanical in name application. I prefer uncapitalized names in ordinary text, as it also permits for the formation of plurals or other word grammar without confusing the reader as to whether or not the game name is plural. (Some of those are, some are not.)

Hope this helps you sort out the best way to deal with links. Giles (talk) 04:46, 1 February 2024 (UTC)

Hello Giles, on 30 December 2023, we performed a bunch of edits lowercasing the links, which is how it should look, but about 2-3 hours later, Margot reversed our edits for no reason at all. We just did this because I got told off about capital letters for links. Margot got angry about us doing it, can you add a new topic to Margot's Talk Page about it? Thanks. 9000 (talk) 05:34, 1 February 2024 (UTC)

Apparently, she and I have a different opinion about it. However, right now, while we're awaiting a new release, the wiki is looking at massive changes just ahead. If you want to press the issue, you'll have to take it up with her. I don't know what her reasons are based on, but I won't trouble her at this time. Giles (talk) 18:44, 9 February 2024 (UTC)

Oh, and one more thing: you can drop the royal "we" when you're talking to me! I do not accept the assertion of superiority! Giles (talk) 18:46, 9 February 2024 (UTC)

And another thing while we're at it. I don't track your activity. But one edit I saw from last week made link changes I would not have made myself, nor did I suggest something like that in what I wrote to you. I have noted that you tend to have a literalistic, legalistic way of interpreting all writing around here (and its grammar), and that is quite simply an inappropriate way to treat language and communication. Language is the way it is because it needs to be flexible in everyday life. Yes, if it's not used grammatically, what comes out may not be clear or particularly useful, but that's the author's worry. Read some literature. The best writers have an instinct about what a language can or ought to do that goes beyond the guidelines of grammar - which are guidelines, not absolute rules.

Hello Giles, I'm tempted to ask Margot to say why are you reversing my edits on links, I'm not gonna ask her, because we don't think she'll answer regardless of what we say, we think she doesn't like us changing links to pages, may you please start a new discussion to Margot's Talk Page about why she is doing this? Thank you. 9000 (talk) 05:39, 15 February 2024 (UTC)

No, I will not ask her. That's your job. And bug off! I'm not your errand boy. Giles (talk) 00:11, 16 February 2024 (UTC)

Please refrain from being in this mean abuse, it tells you to be polite in the Talkheader. Thank you. 9000 (talk • contributions) 08:09, 16 March 2024 (UTC)

I've made my objections clear and I am not abusive. But no, I do not need to do your bidding, and I don't appreciate the pestering, nor your opinion. You may have your view, but I claim my own as well. Let's leave it there. Giles (talk) 05:49, 18 March 2024 (UTC)

## Bad Edits

You have continued to make bad edits that do not improve the wiki. One more, and I will be forced to ban you until after the release of v1.6, if not longer. I've been cleaning up after your bad edits for more than a month, and I'm done doing so, as I do not have the time for this kind of folly. Please consider this your final warning. If the edit does not add new information **with a code reference** then refrain from making it. margotbean (talk) 08:22, 17 February 2024 (UTC)

## Your Recent Edit on Mines

For years I've been reading the wording, oblivious to the fact that "these minecarts" are not "those minecarts". Nice catch. Giles (talk) 21:57, 24 March 2024 (UTC)

## Editing the wiki

I appreciate that you want to make the wiki better, but the bulk of your edits are not improvements, only changes. This takes time for me to patrol, during a time that is busier than I've ever experienced. Please stop making edits that don't add content. In addition, repeatedly undoing admin edits is cause for a ban from the wiki. Please stop making my job more difficult. Consider coming back when v1.6 is released on console, and you have some playtime in the game with the new changes. Thank you, margotbean (talk) 00:45, 20 April 2024 (UTC)

My edits do improve the Wiki and English is my first language. Periods and other symbols after reference links or an extra space before them looks like gibberish to us, as well as making links look like `the [[The Farm|farm]]` instead of `[[The Farm|the farm]]` as an example. Also, please stop ending your posts with commas instead of periods. Thank you. 9000 (talk • contributions) 05:36, 20 April 2024 (UTC)
