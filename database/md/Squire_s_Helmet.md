The **Squire's Helmet** is a hat that can be obtained as a monster drop from Metal Heads, Hot Heads and Metal Head (dangerous). The Squire's Helmet will drop when the number of Metal Heads / Hot Heads / Metal Heads (dangerous) killed + a unique ID assigned to the save file can divide evenly by 100, with no remainder. In the worst case scenario, 99 Metal Heads must be slain to obtain the first Helmet. \[1]
