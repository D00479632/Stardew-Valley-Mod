## CC redirect

Hello Zamiel, I would prefer not to redirect to any Creative Commons pages from a disambiguation page that includes main Stardew content. You should find that typing "com" into the search box produces "Community Center" as one of the results. If you can train yourself to type "com" in lower-case instead of "CC" in upper-case, you should get to the Community Center page quickly. margotbean (talk) 15:34, 17 January 2022 (UTC)

If you don't want a redirect because it is ambiguous, but you acknowledge that an ambiguation page doesn't make sense because no-one would be searching for Creative Commons on the Stardew Valley Wiki specifically, can you justify deleting the CC redirect in some other way that makes sense? --Zamiel (talk) 18:25, 17 January 2022 (UTC)

Hey Zamiel, it sounds like you've misunderstood what I wrote. There are several reasons I think a redirect from a 2-character pagename isn't a good idea, two of which are that you can get to the Community Center page by typing "com" without having to use capital letters, and that two characters is too short of an abbreviation to have a *dis*ambiguation page. "CC" could stand for many things, one of which is outside of the main namespace. So, while I understand that it might be your preference, I made the decision I feel is best for the wiki. I am sorry if you disagree. margotbean (talk) 20:04, 17 January 2022 (UTC)

Why are they being deleted? --Zamiel (talk) 19:37, 11 July 2024 (UTC)

Guides and resources belong on the official forums margotbean (talk) 19:46, 11 July 2024 (UTC)

The templates in question cannot be replicated on the forums, since they are not just text, but they contain code. You can inspect them to see what they do. --Zamiel (talk) 20:32, 11 July 2024 (UTC)

Then they will be lost as of July 18. margotbean (talk) 20:40, 11 July 2024 (UTC)

Why not make an exception to keep them, since they cannot be replicated on the official forums, which seems to be the whole justification of wanting to delete them in the first place? --Zamiel (talk) 20:46, 11 July 2024 (UTC)
