*This article is about the artifact. For the fruit seed, see Ancient Seeds.*

The **Ancient Seed** is an Artifact that can be found by digging up an Artifact Spot in Cindersap Forest or The Mountain (including the Quarry), or obtained inside Artifact Troves, or Fishing Treasure Chests after reaching Fishing level 2. It can be dropped from Bugs, Grubs, Cave Flies, Mutant Flies, and Mutant Grubs (0.5% chance). It can also found by cutting foliage on Prehistoric Floors, in The Mines when they are in a "Dangerous" state, or in the Volcano Dungeon\[1]. Placing a packet of Ancient Seeds in a Deconstructor yields an Ancient Seed.

This artifact can be crafted into viable seeds that can be planted to grow Ancient Fruit during Spring, Summer and Fall, or during any season in the Greenhouse or the Ginger Island farm.
