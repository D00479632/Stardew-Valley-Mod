The **Napalm Ring** is a ring that can be obtained as a reward from Gil at the Adventurer's Guild after completing the Monster Eradication Goal of killing 250 Serpents or Royal Serpents. After that, it can be purchased from Marlon for data-sort-value="30000"&gt;30,000g.

While Napalm Ring is equipped, killing a monster will make it explode like a small bomb that does not damage the player, but destroys rocks, fallen mummies, and forageables in the immediate vicinity.\[1]

Equipping a second Napalm Ring causes two identical explosions to happen simultaneously, damaging nearby monsters twice.\[2]

Downing a mummy with the Napalm Ring equipped *does not* kill the mummy; the explosion will only kill mummies which were previously downed and are caught in the blast.

**Note:** The Napalm Ring is non-destructive on the farm and inside the Slime Hutch. It will only damage monsters.
