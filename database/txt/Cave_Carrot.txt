The Cave Carrot is found via foraging in The Mines. It can also be found in Garbage Cans. Large quantities can be easily obtained by digging underground patches of dirt in The Mines (on levels 10-20) with the Hoe. It may also randomly be found in the Traveling Cart stock for 100–1,000g. Vincent sells a Cave Carrot in his shop at the Desert Festival for 2 Calico Eggs. One Cave Carrot can sometimes be purchased for 500g from Pierre's booth at the Feast of the Winter Star.
