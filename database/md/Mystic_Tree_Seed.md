Note that Mystic Tree Seeds can only be obtained by crafting. They cannot be obtained from chopping or shaking Mystic Trees. Also, Mystic Trees do not spread seeds when fully grown.\[1]

Mystic Tree Seeds fertilized with Tree Fertilizer have a 30% chance of growing to the next stage each night, including during Winter. Unfertilized seeds have a 15% chance of growing to the next stage each night during Spring, Summer, or Fall.\[1]
