The Quality Sprinkler is a crafted item that waters the 8 adjacent tiles every morning (a 3x3 area). Only tilled tiles will be watered. The Quality Sprinkler is unlocked at Farming level 6, and is a reward for completing the Summer Crops Bundle in the Pantry and the Garden Bundle in the Pantry (Remixed). It can also randomly rotate into stock at the Traveling Cart for 1,350–2,250g. Four Quality Sprinklers may occasionally be found in treasure rooms in the Skull Cavern. One Quality Sprinkler is one of the prizes from the Trout Derby festival. One Quality Sprinkler may be received from opening a Mystery Box or Golden Mystery Box. Four Quality Sprinklers can be obtained as the seventh prize from the Prize Machine in the Mayor's Manor (33% chance).
Sprinklers cannot be used to water Garden Pots or a pet's water bowl. Sprinklers cannot be placed on sand.
A Torch can be placed on a Quality Sprinkler to provide minimal lighting in the dark.
