Tailoring
Piña Colada is used in the spool of a Sewing Machine to create the Black Leather Jacket.
Notes
Though it cannot be cooked, its underlying category in the game's data files is "Cooking", so Piña Colada shows up on the "Cooked Items" tab of the Gift Log on the Social tab in-game after giving it as a gift.
Because it is a "cooked" item, it cannot be added to the Luau soup.
Trivia
A Piña Colada is typically an alcoholic cocktail, and the item shares the description "Drink in moderation" with the other alcoholic beverages in the game. However, drinking Piña Colada does not apply the Tipsy debuff.
Penny can recommend Piña Colada as a gift for her mother.
