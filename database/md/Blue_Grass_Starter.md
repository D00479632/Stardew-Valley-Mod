**Blue Grass Starters** will instantly place a patch of Blue Grass when used on the ground. Over time, a patch of blue grass will grow and spread to surrounding tiles on the farm. Blue Grass can be harvested similarly to normal Grass with the Scythe to produce Hay, once a Silo is built. Blue Grass Starters can be planted in Winter, but they won't grow and spread to surrounding tiles.
