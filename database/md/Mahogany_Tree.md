A **Mahogany Tree** is a common tree that grows from a Mahogany Seed. It yields Sap every day when tapped. It can be chopped down with an axe, producing 8-13 Hardwood.\[1]

Mahogany Seeds fertilized with Tree Fertilizer have a 60% chance of growing to the next stage each night, including during Winter. Unfertilized seeds have a 15% chance of growing to the next stage. This means that unfertilized mahogany trees usually grow in 26±12 days, while fertilized ones usually grow in 7±2 days.

Mahogany Trees may spawn on floors 41-69 of The Mines when either the "Danger in the Deep" Quest is active or the Shrine of Challenge is toggled on.
