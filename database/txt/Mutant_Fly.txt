Mutant Flies are an enemy found in the Mutant Bug Lair and on Prehistoric Floors in the Skull Cavern. 80 cave insects (any type) need to be killed for the Monster Eradication Goal at the Adventurer's Guild.
They can hatch from Mutant Grubs if the player gets close and allows it to enter its cocoon phase. Mutant Grubs hatch shortly after entering their cocoon into Mutant Flies.
Behavior
They will fly towards the player (including through walls) at high speeds and deal damage on contact. They will then loop around for another pass.
Strategy
Stand still and swing with a sword that has high knockback right before the fly makes contact.
History
1.1: Introduced.
1.6: Changed Monster Eradication Goal for cave insects from 125 to 80.
