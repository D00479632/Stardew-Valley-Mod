The **Truffle** is a type of mushroom that can only be spawned by an adult Pig on The Farm when the pig is outside the Barn. Since pigs do not go out of the barn in winter, they spawn no truffles in that season. It can also be dropped from Truffle Crabs. It may also randomly appear at the Traveling Cart for data-sort-value="625"1,875–3,125g.

Despite being spawned by pigs, truffles are not considered to be animal products, like eggs or milk. They do not receive a price increase from the Rancher profession.

Despite being mushrooms, Truffles technically are also not considered to be foraged items, but give Foraging XP when picked up on the farm. They are not among the items included in the foraging category at the Stardew Valley Fair, nor are they labeled as "Forage" in inventory. They do, however, benefit from the Gatherer and Botanist professions. Truffles and Red Mushroom are also the only mushrooms that cannot be placed into a Dehydrator.

Truffles not gathered on the 28th day of a season disappear on the following morning, the 1st day of the new season.
