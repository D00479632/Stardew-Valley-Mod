Mr. Qi

The **Casino** is located in the Calico Desert accessed through the back door of the Oasis. Access is initially blocked by the Bouncer until "The Mysterious Qi" quest is completed.

Mr. Qi is constantly present in the room. To his right is a machine to exchange gold for Qi coins, at a rate of data-sort-value="1000"&gt;1,000g per data-sort-value="100"&gt;100, or data-sort-value="10"&gt;10g per data-sort-value="1"&gt;1 value. Qi coins are used for both gambling and purchasing items inside the Casino, and cannot be converted back to gold.

To the top-left of the room is a terminal that lists multiple statistics for the Player.

There are two forms of gambling available, slot machines and a variant of BlackJack, CalicoJack. There are two tables for CalicoJack, low stakes (data-sort-value="100"&gt;100) to the left and high stakes (data-sort-value="1000"&gt;1,000) to the right.

In the upper right corner of the room, to the right of the machine for exchanging Qi coins and next to a potted plant, stands a shady individual who offers to sell Statues Of Endless Fortune for data-sort-value="1000000"&gt;1,000,000g each.

## Store
