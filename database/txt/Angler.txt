The Angler is a fish that can be caught in Pelican Town during Fall. It is one of the five Legendary Fish, so it can only be caught once per save file, or once per player in Multiplayer.
The special requirements necessary to hook an Angler are:[1]
Fishing level 3, either naturally or using Fishing Buffs.
The player must be standing at the northernmost end of the river (within 15 tiles of the map edge). This includes the wooden plank bridge, all shoreline north of the bridge, as well as the shoreline up to three tiles south of the wood bridge.
There is no Fishing Zone requirement; the bobber can be located anywhere in the river as long as the player is standing in a valid location.
When all of these requirements are met, each cast has a 20% chance of hooking an Angler (25% if using a Curiosity Lure).
Although the Angler cannot be hooked again after it is caught, it is possible to obtain multiple Anglers (per player) by using Challenge Bait to catch it or by Panning in the correct tiles with the Fisher enchantment.
The Angler can be caught regardless of season using Magic Bait.
