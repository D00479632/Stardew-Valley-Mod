Notes
Despite being only one block wide, it is still possible to ride a horse through any orientation of gate in any direction.
Breaking the gate with a pickaxe does not destroy it, so you can break it and immediately replace it the day before it degrades.
A gate can replace a placed fence piece by selecting the gate in inventory and clicking on the fence piece. If surrounded by other Stone Fence or Hardwood Fence pieces, the gate will take on the color of the fence instead of the normal dark brown color.
History
1.4: Two gates can now be placed next to each other, allowing for double-width gates.
1.6: Fixed gates popping off when opening or closing them while the player overlaps the tile.
