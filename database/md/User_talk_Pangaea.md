## Your question about arrays

Hello Pangaea! I've moved your question about arrays to your user page. I don't want to sound mean, but the Admin noticeboard asks that users not post questions about mediawiki syntax or formatting there. I understand you want the increased visibility of the page, but the last bullet point specifically requests that users not use the page for that purpose.

I don't have an answer to your question right now either, I'm afraid. I'm a bit short on time today. I will keep it in mind, and if I find the answer, I will definitely post a comment on your talk page. Fair enough? Thanks for your understanding!! margotbean (talk) 18:22, 9 September 2022 (UTC)

Gee. Sorry, I didn't see that. Since there was already talk about extensions, thought it would be fine to ask for advice about a workaround since it didn't look likely to get new extensions installed. I've been fiddling around and looks like I may have found a workaround, so that was nice. Pangaea (talk) 18:34, 9 September 2022 (UTC)
