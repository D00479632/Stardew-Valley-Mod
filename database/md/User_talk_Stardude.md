Go to the user talk page of who you want to ask, then tap edit, scroll down to the bottom and tap at the bottom, and press the “return” key and then, on your new line (note there should be a one line gap between the previous text, and where you are typing) type 2 of these right next to each other like this. —&gt; == press space and type a headline for your question and then press space and use the 2 equal signs again. Step 2 the question. Press return twice for a one line gap between your heading and where you would type, now type in your question/problem. Step 3. In progress

Oh, hey margotbean! Thanks for the tip for me and others, you’ve always been helpful (I’m not being sarcastic k?). Happy dealing with those annoying little trolls! Stardude (talk) 22:25, 4 December 2022 (UTC)
