A **Duggy** is an enemy found in the Mines. It appears in tillable soil that the player has walked over. It pops up, then retreats back into the soil, leaving a visible hole. The hoe cannot be used on top of these holes. 30 Duggies (any type) need to be killed for the Monster Eradication Goal at the Adventurer's Guild.

## Behavior

Duggies can be found within dirt patches in the cave floor, attempting to pop up and attack the player. Duggies can move and sense the player for up to two tiles.

## Strategy

Attack the Duggy once when it appears from behind, then keep moving. This prevents it from appearing directly under the player and dealing unavoidable damage. Standing on the edge of a dirt patch and quickly stepping into the dirt and back to bait a duggy out is another good strategy to kill them. Damage can be negated by blocking with a sword.
