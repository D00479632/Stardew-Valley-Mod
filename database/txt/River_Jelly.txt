River Jelly is an item that can be caught using a Fishing Pole during all seasons in the river in Pelican Town and Cindersap Forest, the mountain lake, the Cindersap Forest pond, the pond at the Desert, the pond in the Secret Woods, at Ginger Island West (freshwater) and North, and on all Farm Maps except for the Standard and Beach Farm Maps. Each level of Luck Buff applied significantly increases the chance of catching it. Daily Luck has no effect.
It can also be acquired from a Midnight Carp Fish Pond with a population of at least 7. The Bookseller may trade 3 River Jelly for 1 Jewels Of The Sea each, provided the player has already earned the power from that book. It can also be gifted by a pet cat with max friendship.
River Jelly is displayed in the Fish section of the collection tab, and counts towards the four fishing Achievements. However, it is otherwise not considered to be a fish, and therefore cannot be sold to Willy at the Fish Shop, does not benefit from fish price bonuses, cannot be used in place of "Any Fish" in recipes, and cannot be put in a Bait Maker, Fish Smoker, or Fish Pond.

Tailoring
River Jelly is not used in any tailoring. It can be used in dyeing, serving as a green dye at the dye pots located in Emily's and Haley's house, 2 Willow Lane. It can also be used as a green dye when used in the spool of the Sewing Machine with a dyeable clothing item in the feed.
Bundles
River Jelly is not used in any bundles.
Quests
One River Jelly is requested by Midnight Carp in a Fish Pond quest to increase the capacity of the pond from 5 to 10.
Strategy
The best rates for River Jelly are when fishing in the freshwater pond in Ginger Island West using a Training Rod. Under these conditions, there are only 2 possible catches: River Jelly and Snake Skull, as all of the fish that can be caught have difficulty greater than or equal to 50. Only if the farmer fails the random check to catch both of these will the farmer get Trash.
However, unlike when catching regular fish or other items, the random value used to determine whether a River Jelly is successfully caught is predetermined. This value only changes when catching a Cave, River, or Sea Jelly, or any Fish. It is not changed by catching Algae, Trash, or any other catchable items.[1] Because of this, after catching Trash using the Training Rod, it is necessary to catch a regular fish before another River Jelly. This can easily be done by switching to any Fishing Pole other than the Training Rod, continuing to fish until an actual fish is caught, and switching back to the Training Rod.
Ordinarily, 10% of possible random values result in a successful River Jelly catch. Each level of Luck Buff increases the chance of a successful catch by 5%.[2] So with +8 Luck, 50% of random values will result in a successful catch. This allows for longer streaks without failing a River Jelly catch, although the player will still unavoidably catch some Snake Skulls.
It is also possible to achieve similar rates when fishing in either Desert pond, although either Green Algae or Pyramid Decal instead of Snake Skulls will be the alternative drop. Fishing in the Desert does not require use of the Training Rod if done after 8 pm or in the lower pond, as there are no fish to be caught. However, this also means that there is no convenient way to refresh the Jelly's random value once it changes to a failing value.

↑ See GameLocation::GetFishFromLocationData and FishingRod::tickUpdate in the game code. The seeded RNG function is only progressed when the "PreciseFishCaught" stat is incremented, and "PreciseFishCaught" is only incremented on catching a fish or item with the "counts_as_fish_catch" tag from a non-fish pond. The only items with that tag are Sea, River, and Cave Jelly, see Objects.xnb in the game files.
