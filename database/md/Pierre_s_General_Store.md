Abigail

**Pierre's General Store** sells various seeds, saplings, fertilizer, ingredients and other useful items. As well as selling those items, Pierre also buys foraged items, crops and crop seeds, artisan goods, cooked dishes, and animal products from the player. This avoids waiting overnight for shipping, but does not count as shipping for the purpose of achievements or collections. Some products in stock, namely seeds, will vary from season to season and others are in-stock year-round. Pierre's main competitor in the valley is JojaMart.

Outside of Pierre's General Store to the left of the entrance, the player can find a calendar and a "Help Wanted" board.

Pierre's General Store is normally open most days at 9am, three hours after the player wakes up, and closes at 5pm. The player can enter the building until 9pm, but Pierre leaves the sales counter at 5pm every day, so the shop cannot actually be used to purchase or sell goods after 5pm. This is because the building also serves as Pierre's family home.

Tip: When purchasing items, the player can buy multiples of 5 by holding Shift + right- or left-click, multiples of 25 by holding Control + Shift + right- or left-click, and a full stack of 999 by holding Control + Shift + 1 + left-click.

## Events

Several events can affect the store's operating hours and stock.

- Pierre stays closed on Wednesday unless all of the Community Center bundles are finished or the player obtains the Key To The Town, and then Pierre's General Store will be open 7 days a week.
- By returning Pierre's Missing Stocklist, he will sell seeds from every season all year-round (at a 50% markup for out-of-season seeds).
  
  - Seeds which are not sold until year 2 will not be included in this stock expansion in year 1, and players will still need to wait until year 2 to purchase them.
- After having 8 hearts of friendship with a marriage candidate, a bouquet of flowers will also be available for purchase.

## Player-Derived Stock

If the player chooses to sell items to Pierre, there is a chance they will appear in the list of items for sale, especially if sold to Pierre in large quantity. Any of these items that are edible will be available for purchase in limited quantities. Additional villager dialogues may appear indicating they've seen or purchased the items. Villagers tend to be disgusted by those of normal quality and enjoy silver or higher quality items.

## Living quarters

Abigail's room and Pierre/Caroline's bedroom are to the north of the shop. In the middle is a large area used for exercise class on Tuesdays from 1-4pm, which Caroline, Jodi, Robin, Emily and Marnie will attend. To the top right is the Kitchen and a door to Caroline's sun room. To the east is a shrine of Yoba which is used for religious ceremonies on Sundays.

## Bugs

- After obtaining the Key To The Town, Pierre will stand behind the sales counter at 6am. At 7am he will leave the sales counter and walk to the store shelves, and the player will be unable to purchase anything. At 8:30am he will leave the store shelves and return to the sales counter.

## Trivia

- Pierre often takes credit for finding or cooking items that the player has sold to him as player-derived stock.
- In Winter, when walking into the shop, Pierre might say: "Welcome to Pierre's heated shop!" Upon talking to him, he says: "Is it just me or is there a cold draft in here?".
- In Winter, when walking into the shop, Pierre might say: "Seeds for sale!" despite not selling seeds during winter.
- When entering Pierre's shop, there is a low chance for a dialogue bubble to pop up with him saying "Did you remember your wallet?".
