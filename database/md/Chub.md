The **Chub** is a fish that can be caught in the mountain lake and the Cindersap Forest River during all seasons. Unlike most fish found in the Forest River, it cannot be caught in Pelican Town. It can also be gifted by a pet cat with max friendship. It may also randomly appear in Krobus' shop on Wednesdays for data-sort-value="200"&gt;200g, or at the Traveling Cart for data-sort-value="50"150–1,000g.
