About the notes...
I'm not sure whether it is bad wording, I'm not understanding the context, or if it's incorrect, but it seems that in the notes, it says that Emily references the desert trader on her birthday, by saying "My friend runs a shop in the desert. If you ever go there stop in and say hi for me. I think she sells some rare products." I think she's talking about Sandy, and not the trader, because she says "stop in", not stop by. I may just be overthinking this, but it looks like it needs to be corrected, and I don't want to before questioning, lest I mess something up. And she talks about her friend Sandy before this, so that's also why I think she's talking about Sandy. PrismaticGlasses (talk) 02:21, 27 October 2021 (UTC)
Hi there! As it is, it's written Sandy mentions the Desert Trader [time specification]: [quote]. So it's Sandy who speaks and she talks about the desert trader, who happens to be her friend. I didn't check in the game, but I kind of remember she [Sandy] said something like that once. I guess the "... she sells..." within the quote is confusing. Charly (talk) 15:55, 27 October 2021 (UTC)
The note is incorrect. It is Emily who says this, referring to Sandy. You can see the quote on Emily's page. The note should probably be moved to a different page.Pangaea (talk) 15:12, 5 September 2022 (UTC)
