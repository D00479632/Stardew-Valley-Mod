The **Daffodil** is found via foraging in the Spring, or grown from Spring Seeds. Up to ten can also be purchased from Pierre at the Flower Dance for data-sort-value="50"&gt;50g each. Up to five may be purchased from Evelyn's shop at the Desert Festival for data-sort-value="15"&gt; 15 Calico Eggs each. It can randomly be found in Garbage Cans during Spring. The Statue Of Endless Fortune produces one Daffodil per year on Sandy's birthday, Fall 15. Although it is a flower in its description (and in real life), the game classifies it as "Forage" and not "Flower."
