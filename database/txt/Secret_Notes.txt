Secret Notes are collectible notes that can be unlocked by walking to the Bus Stop from The Farm during Winter between 6am and 4pm. The player will see a cutscene in which a "Shadow Guy" (who could be Krobus) startles and runs away. After seeing the cutscene, the quest "A Winter Mystery" is added to the player's journal.
The Shadow Guy's footsteps lead to a bush next to the playground, left of the Community Center. If the player interacts with the bush, the Shadow Guy will pop out of it, apologize for stealing, give the player a Magnifying Glass, then run away. The Magnifying Glass gives the player the ability to find Secret Notes while digging, chopping trees, mining, fishing, or killing monsters.
Once found, a Secret Note can be read by selecting it in the top row of inventory and right-clicking (as if consuming food). This will add the note to the player's collection, and enable the Secret Notes collection tab on the player menu.
Some notes will list "Loved" gifts for certain characters, while others will have images depicting puzzle solutions. Reading notes that list gift preferences will add the gifts to the villager's Gift Log on the Social tab of the player menu.
Secret Notes can be gifted, but they are all universally hated.

Secret Note Sources
The following table lists the different actions that can spawn a secret note.
The "Chance" column below indicates the probabilities that the game will attempt to spawn a secret note. When such an attempt is made, the game performs a further check to see if it succeeds, based on the number of notes of the appropriate type (Journal Scraps on Ginger Island, regular Secret Notes elsewhere) that the player has already found. If all notes have been found, the check fails. Otherwise, the probability of success is a linear function of the number of notes found, where there's an 80% chance of success if no notes have been found, and a 12% chance of success if all but one have been found [1].
Activity Chance
Weeds [2] 0.9%
Monsters [3] 3.3%
Chopping trees (Each Axe hit) [4] 0.5%
Fishing [5] 8% to replace trash
Artifact Spot [6] 11% (After artifact checks and winter forage checks)
Stone [7] 0.75%
Resource clump * [8] 5%
Giant crop [9] 100%
* Resource Clump = Large Stump, Large Log, Meteorite, or Boulder (inside or outside The Mines).
