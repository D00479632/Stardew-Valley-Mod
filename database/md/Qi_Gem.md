Mr. QiÂ (Quests)

Monsters in dangerous Mines or Skull Cavern Sell Price *Cannot be sold*

**Qi Gems** are obtained by completing challenges in Mr. Qi's walnut room on Ginger Island, and used to buy rewards in the same room. They can also be received from selling Golden Walnuts and can be dropped from monsters in the "dangerous" version of the Mines and during the Skull Cavern Invasion quest. Stick Bugs in the Dangerous Mines are guaranteed to drop a Qi Gem when slain, with a 50% chance of dropping an extra one. The amount of Qi Gems that a player has is displayed directly underneath the Player's name in the skills tab.

## Tips

Two easy ways to convert Qi Gems into gold are:

- Buying Hoppers and deconstructing them using deconstructors into radioactive bars which sell for data-sort-value="3000"&gt;3,000g each (data-sort-value="4500"&gt;4,500g with the Blacksmith profession). This method is more profitable, but takes more time and requires deconstructors. Using this method, each Qi Gem is worth data-sort-value="300"&gt;300g (data-sort-value="450"&gt;450g with the Blacksmith profession).
- Buying Qi Seasoning which sell for data-sort-value="200"&gt;200g each. Using this method, each Qi Gem is worth data-sort-value="200"&gt;200g.

## Bugs

- Because the on-screen gem count display contains only 3 digits, having 1000 or more Qi Gems causes the display to show only the last 3 digits.
