**Fried Calamari** is a cooked dish. It is prepared using either the kitchen inside an upgraded farmhouse or a Cookout Kit.

Fried Calamari may randomly appear in Krobus' shop on Saturdays, in the Garbage Can outside the saloon, or in the Stardrop Saloon's rotating stock. Linus may randomly send Fried Calamari in the mail as a gift. One Fried Calamari may be received from opening a Mystery Box. The Statue Of Endless Fortune produces one Fried Calamari per year on Pierre's birthday, Spring 26.

Although it is a type of squid, Midnight Squid cannot be used in the recipe for Fried Calamari.

## Tailoring

Fried Calamari is used in the spool of the Sewing Machine with Cloth in the feed to create a Store Owner's Jacket. It is a yellow dye when used in the spool of the Sewing Machine with a dyeable clothing item in the feed. It can be placed in the yellow dye pot at Emily's and Haley's house, 2 Willow Lane, for use in dyeing.

The Store Owner's Jacket bears a resemblance to the one worn by Pierre, who owns a store and likes Fried Calamari.
