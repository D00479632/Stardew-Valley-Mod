Copper Nodes can spawn in the Quarry, the Quarry Mine, or in the quarry on the Hill-top and Four Corners Farm Maps.
Copper Nodes can be found on any floor of the Skull Cavern and Volcano Dungeon.
Can be found in breakable crates and barrels in the Mines.
Can be found by tilling soil in the Mines.
Can be dropped by Metal Heads on floors 80-119 of the Mines.
Can be dropped by Copper Slimes in the Quarry Mine or random dungeon floors in the Mines.
Can be found inside any of the 4 types of Geode.
