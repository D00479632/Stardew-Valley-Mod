Catalogue Provides unlimited access to all wallpapers and floors... from the convenience of your home! Information Source(s) Pierre's General Store Sell Price Cannot be sold

The **Catalogue** is a piece of Furniture that can be purchased from Pierre's General Store for data-sort-value="30000"&gt;30,000g.

Once placed, in the catalogue allows the player to purchase many wallpaper and flooring items for data-sort-value="0"&gt;0g in unlimited quantity. The Catalogue does not include certain special wallpapers like the Mystery Wallpaper or those exclusive to other catalogues.

The catalogue is similar to the Furniture Catalogue sold at the Carpenter's Shop, which gives access to Furniture items.

**Tip:** Shift + on an item in the Catalogue or Furniture Catalogue will add it directly to inventory, instead of attaching it to the mouse cursor.

## Trivia

- This is one of the few items in the game that is spelled using British English instead of American English (where the *-ue* ending would be dropped, becoming *catalog*).
