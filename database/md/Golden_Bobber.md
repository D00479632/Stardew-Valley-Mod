The **Golden Bobber** is a special item which is required for the "Golden Bobber" quest from Willy during the Desert Festival on Spring 17.

It is obtained from Fishing Treasure Chests. After activating the quest, the next treasure chest obtained that day is guaranteed to have the Golden Bobber. Multiple Golden Bobbers can be obtained in the same day as long as the player does not currently have a Golden Bobber in their inventory while fishing.\[1]
