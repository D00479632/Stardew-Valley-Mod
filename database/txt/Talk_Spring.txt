salmonberry season
In main section says the salmonberry season is spring 15-17, but Event section says it is spring 15-18. Which is the correct? Mmtraa7 (talk) 16:04, 27 November 2024 (UTC)
It's the 18th, I've corrected it! margotbean (talk) 17:17, 27 November 2024 (UTC)
Missing fish
Bream, Bullhead, Carp, Chub and Largemouth Bass are missing from the Spring page <3 (Stardoo (talk) 04:41, 9 January 2025 (UTC))
I encourage you to read the 2nd sentence under the "Fish" heading: Fish that can be caught during all seasons are not listed. margotbean (talk) 14:06, 9 January 2025 (UTC)
