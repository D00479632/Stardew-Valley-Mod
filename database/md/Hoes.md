From Stardew Valley Wiki

The **Hoe** is a tool obtained at the beginning of the game. It is used primarily to till soil for Farming, and to dig up Artifact Spots.

The hoe may also be used to till sand in The Mines, on The Beach, or in The Desert, as well as other areas of Stardew Valley that have exposed soil. Tilling sand in the Mines may yield Artifacts, Cave Carrots, and other items. Above ground, tilling soil may yield Clay, metal ores, or Mixed Seeds. In Winter, many more areas can be tilled. These may additionally yield Snow Yams or Winter Roots.

The Hoe may be upgraded at the Blacksmith. The cost and resource requirements for each upgrade are shown in the table below. To till more than one tile at a time, hold left-click to "power-up" an upgraded Hoe, then release it to till an area. While charging an upgraded Hoe, the tool hit area can be adjusted by moving the character, who will continue to face in the same direction.
