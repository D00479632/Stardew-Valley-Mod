*This page is for crops that grow on tilled land. For fruit that grows on trees, see Fruit Trees.*

**Crops** are plants that are grown from seeds to be harvested for the purpose of profit, food, or gifting. Generally, each crop is seasonal. It can be planted only during its designated season, and when seasons change (after the 28th day), the crop will wither and die. Multi-season crops (*i.e.,* Ancient Fruit, Coffee Bean, Corn, Sunflower, and Wheat), however, will continue to grow during all specified seasons.

## Basics

### Monsters

Monsters (either on the Wilderness Farm or toggled on by the Dark Shrine of Night Terrors on any farm) have no effect on crops.

### Crows

Crops can be eaten by Crows when there are over 15 crops growing and there is no Scarecrow within range.

### Farm Animals

Farm Animals never trample or destroy crops. They may get in the way of planting or harvesting efforts, but will never cause damage to crops.

### Fertilizing and Planting

Fallow (untilled) farm land must be tilled with the Hoe before fertilizing or planting there, an activity that consumes some of the player's daily energy, as reflected on the energy bar. A tile may be watered (by using the Watering Can) only after it has been tilled, which consumes more energy.

Seeds and fertilizer are placed on a tilled tile individually by using the left-click control, or on multiple tiles by continuously holding on to the right-click or left-click control and moving the cursor and/or player. Since planting and fertilizing require no tool use, those activities consume none of the player's energy.

Only one type of fertilizer at a time may be used on any given tile. Some fertilizer must be placed on a tile before a seed is planted there, other types can be placed before or after planting a seed. Watering can be done at any time after tilling, and freely either before or after fertilizing and/or planting, without regard to order.

### Trellis Crops

Some crops require a trellis, which cannot be walked through, so they require an appropriate crop layout to be reachable. Trellis crops can be walked through once they are dead.

The available trellis crops are Green Bean, Hops, and Grape.

### Grow Times

The grow times shown on this page (and in the game) *exclude* the day the seeds were planted. If planting on the first of a season, a 5-day crop will be ready for harvest on day 6, not day 5. In this case, the number may be thought of as the number of *nights* required to grow the crop.

Fertilizer and the Agriculturist Profession are *not* taken into account on this page, but the effects can be viewed on individual crop pages.

Crops must be watered every day for maximum growth. If unwatered for a day, a crop will not grow. Unwatered crops do not die, but they will not grow either.

If a seed is planted into unwatered soil and not watered the same day, it will not grow that night. Growth will start the following night. The grow times on this page assume the seeds are watered the day they are planted.

Planting after midnight does not impose a penalty (it still counts as having been planted on the current day).

### End of Season

On the 1st of each season, all crops that are no longer in season will wither and die, leaving behind a dead crop. When a dead crop is left behind at the start of a season it will keep the soil it was planted on tilled, which can reduce the amount of manual tilling and watering that needs to be done at the start of a season. Dead crops can be removed with a scythe.

Multi-season crops that are still in season (*i.e.,* corn planted in summer when transitioning into fall) will not wither and will simply continue to grow. Fully grown crops that are ready to harvest will wither and die when moving to a new season, however.

### Giant Crops

Cauliflowers, Melons, Pumpkins, Powdermelons and Qi Fruits planted in a 3x3 pattern can randomly combine into a giant crop. Giant crops drop 15–21 normal-quality items when harvested with any axe, taking three hits.

At the start of each day, every possible 3x3 grid of crops (including overlaps) has a 1% chance to grow into a giant crop as long as the top left crop is fully-grown and watered, and all constituent crops are of the same type. Giant crops won't necessarily appear on the day the crops finish growing; it can happen any day those criteria are met.\[1]

Giant crops don't die at change of season like other crops, and giant Qi Fruits don't disappear after the "Qi's Crop" special order is over. Soil underneath a giant crop may become untilled, causing any fertilizer to be lost. Giant crops cannot grow in the greenhouse, by using Garden Pots, or on Ginger Island.

### Crop Quality

*See also: Crop Quality Formula*

The quality of crops comes in four levels: regular,   silver,   gold, and   iridium. Quality is determined when a crop is harvested. Normally, harvested crops are almost all of regular quality, with a few at silver or gold quality levels. The average quality can be increased by planting seeds into fertilized soil. Note that iridium quality is possible only with Deluxe Fertilizer. Increasing Farming Skill also increases the chance to harvest a quality crop. If a Seed Maker turns a higher-quality crop into seeds, the seeds are **no more likely** to produce higher-quality crops when grown and harvested.

Note that for forage items grown from wild seeds, the quality of the items is determined by foraging skill, not farming skill, making iridium quality foraged items possible with the Botanist profession.

Higher quality crops command higher prices when sold, and deliver greater energy and health benefits when eaten. If given as a gift to an NPC who likes or loves the crop, a silver, gold, or iridium quality crop gives a higher number of friendship points. Crop quality has **no effect** on cooked foods' health or energy gains, or on the quality of Artisan Goods produced.

The quality star of a crop in inventory animates when it is of the highest quality possible (iridium).

For crops that produce multiples at harvest (*i.e.,* Coffee Bean, Blueberry, Cranberries), Basic, Quality and Deluxe Fertilizers affect only the first crop produced. That is, only 1 out of 4 coffee beans is affected at each harvest; only 1 out of 3 blueberries is affected, etc.

### Gold per Day

Calculations do not take into account Fertilizer, crop quality, or the Tiller or Agriculturist Professions. Variations are noted in or below each table, if applicable. It is assumed that the crop is watered on the day of planting.

The general formula is: `Minimum Gold per Day = ((Max Harvests × Sell Price per Harvest) − Seed Price) / Growing Days`

**Growing Days** = `Days to Maturity + ((Max Harvests − 1) × Days to Regrow)`

**Days to Maturity** and **Days to Regrow** are listed in each table.

**Max Harvests** is normally 1, but for crops that continue to produce, it is the actual number of harvests that can be obtained in the growing season(s).

**Sell Price per Harvest** is normally the same as the Sell Price of one normal-quality crop. Extra crops are not counted since their occurrence is rare, except in the case of potatoes. The chance of an extra potato is ≈25%, much higher than with any other crop. Thus, the **Sell Price per Harvest** is 1.25 × 80 instead of 1 × 80.

In the case of plants that always give &gt;1 item per harvest (*e.g.,* Coffee Bean, Blueberry, Cranberries) the **Sell Price per Harvest** = # of crops per Harvest × Sell Price for one item.

Example: Cranberries

Max Harvests = 5

Sell Price per Harvest = 2 berries × data-sort-value="75"&gt;75g = data-sort-value="150"&gt;150g

Seed Price = data-sort-value="240"&gt;240g

Growing Days = 7 + ((5 − 1) × 5) = 27

Gold per Day = (5 × 150 − 240) / 27 = data-sort-value="18.89"&gt;18.89g

### Mixed Seeds

*There's a little bit of everything here. Plant them and see what grows!*

Mixed Seeds are a type of seed that can be planted in any season, except Winter, to grow into a random crop specific to that season. They can be randomly found when cutting weeds with a scythe, by digging up dirt or sand with a hoe, or from a Seed Maker. The Forest Farm has a unique type of weed which always drops Mixed Seeds when destroyed.

Mixed Seeds will turn into the following seeds upon planting. Note that Mixed Seeds can turn into Artichoke Seeds during year 1, despite the fact that Artichoke Seeds are normally unavailable until year 2. During Spring, on the Farm, Parsnip Seeds are twice as likely to be chosen as Cauliflower or Potato Seeds.\[2]

### Wild Seeds

Wild Seeds can be crafted out of foraged plants after learning the recipe at the appropriate foraging level (Spring at level 1, Summer at level 4, Fall at level 6, Winter at level 7). Each recipe will produce 10 seed packets.

When planted, wild seeds will randomly grow into one of that season's foraged plants. Regardless of what ends up growing, all wild seeds take the same amount of time to grow to maturity (7 days, not counting the day planted). Crows do not attack crops grown from Wild Seeds, so the use of Scarecrows is unnecessary.

Since these seeds grow Forage crops, they will always be of iridium quality if the Botanist Profession is chosen.

## Artisan Goods

Crops can be processed into Artisan Goods to increase their sell value. Most Fruits and Vegetables can be processed into Jellies and Pickles via a Preserves Jar, or Wine and Juice via a Keg. Five matching Fruits can be processed into Dried Fruit using a Dehydrator.

Using a Keg, Hops can be processed into Pale Ale, Wheat into Beer, Coffee Beans into Coffee, and Tea Leaves into Green Tea.
