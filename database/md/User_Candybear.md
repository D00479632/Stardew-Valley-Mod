- You can leave a message on my en:talk page or zh:talk page **anytime**.If I notice it I will answer the message quickly.

## **Note**

- First at all, don't use online translators.Maybe they can help people of different languages ​​communicate, but they are never allowed to be used for wiki translation.See help:editing,please.
- Second ,have a discussion with other editors before a big change .For example, I plan to translate the console history into Chinese,but it should unified format at first so I have a discussion about it.
- Last,If your native language is not English, I suggest that you do not write English Wiki text without certainty, because it maybe make mistakes.
