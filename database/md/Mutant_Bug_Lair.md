From Stardew Valley Wiki

The **Mutant Bug Lair** is an underground location that becomes accessible as part of the Dark Talisman Quest. The entrance to the lair is in the northwest corner of The Sewers. Talking to Krobus during this quest will open the passage to this location.

The player should be prepared to encounter monsters before entering the Mutant Bug Lair because there are a number of Mutant Grubs and Mutant Flies inside.

Even though plants are growing here and fishing is possible, the game considers this location to be underground. Therefore, forageable items and artifact spots never spawn here.

## Fishing

Fishing Zones in the Mutant Bug Lair

The Slimejack is a unique fish that can only be caught in the Mutant Bug Lair. Carp, Green Algae, and White Algae are also possible. The available fish are the same year-round. Fishing here is dangerous because Mutant Flies continuously spawn and attack the player. To avoid this, fish right at the entrance before any bugs are triggered.
