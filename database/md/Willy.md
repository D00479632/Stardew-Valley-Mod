The cutscene ends with Willy saying goodbye to his "sweet ladies" as they are taken away to be killed and cooked.

## Quotes

**Regular** 

**First Meeting**

“ “Ahoy there! It's nice to see young folk movin' in to the valley. It's not very common these days.”

**Regular**

“ “Ahoy there, \[son/lass]. Looks like decent weather for fishing, eh?”

“ “Have you had much luck in the local waters? You look like you could be a strong angler if you set your mind to it.”

“ “A true angler has respect for the water... don't you forget that.”

“ “Some fish come and go with the seasons. Others only come out at night or in the rain.”

“ “\*mumble* \*mumble* ...Eh? I would tell you about my thoughts, but it's a fisherman's secret”

“ “ There are rumors of some very rare fish in these parts... but only an experienced angler could stand a chance against them. You'll need the finest bait you can get if you want a rare fish to bite.”

“ “If you really want to get the fish biting, make sure you put some bait on your hook.”

“ “If the local fishing scene got a bit more lively, I might expand the shop's stock.”

“ “If you purchase a high quality fishing rod, you'll be able to attach bait and tackle to the line. Bait causes fish to bite faster. Tackle can make your job a lot easier when reeling fish in. There are all kinds of tackle, with different perks. They're usually a little flimsy, so don't be surprised if your tackle breaks after a while.”

**4+ Hearts, Friday**

“ “I'm a simple man...when my pipe is full, I'm happy. When my pipe is empty...well, then I just fill 'er up again.”

*6+ Hearts*

“ “The ol' Man was a fisherman, you know. I grew up sailing between the fern islands, living from catch to catch. The fishing life is tough, but there's something about it that keeps you goin'.”

**Summer 19**

“ “Tomorrow is the annual Trout Derby... Aye, it's a freshwater enthusiast's dream! Anglers from all over the world will be here to catch our beautiful Rainbow Trout... \[I'd better see you out there, lad!/I hope to see you out there!] For the next two days, I'll only be manning the shop for one hour, starting at 9am. So if you really need somethin', you can come by then.”

**After catching the Legend**

**After catching the Glacierfish**

“ “Ah, so you finally snagged the Glacierfish... That's one of the slipperiest fish I've ever encountered! How many tries did it take ya?”

**After catching the Mutant Carp**

“ “\*sniff* \*sniff\*... Something tells me you've been fishin' in the sewers, \[lad/miss]. It's an unconventional approach, to be sure. There's legend of gargantuan carp, twisted into monsters from the toxic sludge...”

**After filling a Fish Pond with 10 Crabs**

“ “\*sniff\*... Ah... That old familiar scent. You've been raisin' crabs, haven't ya? Yer a \[man/lady] after me own heart, \[Player]. Hah! Here, take this. I found it on the beach... Been savin' it fer a special occasion. It's not every day I discover a fellow crab enthusiast!”

**Events**
