The Magma Cap is a mushroom found via foraging throughout the Volcano Dungeon. It can be confused at a distance with a False Magma Cap. False Magma Caps have a 99% chance to drop a Magma Cap when slain. It can also be acquired from a Stingray Fish Pond with a population of at least 4.
Magma Caps can be used to purchase Pineapple Seeds from the Island Trader (1 Pineapple Seed for 1 Magma Cap).
