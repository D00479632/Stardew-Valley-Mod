Workbench
When crafting here, you'll have access to materials in any adjacent chests.
Information
Source Carpenter's Shop for 2,000g
Sell Price Cannot be sold
The Workbench allows players to craft items using ingredients which are stored in adjacent chests or Big Chests. It can be purchased from the Carpenter's Shop for 2,000g.
The Workbench draws crafting items only from standard adjacent chests or Big Chests, not from Junimo Chests. It can access chests placed on any of the 8 tiles surrounding the Workbench (including diagonally), but at least one tile must be left vacant so the player can access the Workbench in play. The adjacent chests are searched as needed in a fixed search order based on their geographical position in relation to the Workbench. First to last:
SW
due S
SE
due W
due E
NW
due N
NE
Required items may be taken from multiple chests in one craft, even including multiple items of a single type. Multiple crafting of the same target item can continue as long as sufficient supplies of all the required source items is present within the searchable chests.
