The **Ice Rod** is a trinket item obtainable after claiming Combat Mastery. It can be obtained by slaying monsters or breaking crates and barrels in the Mines, Skull Cavern, or Quarry Mine. Drop chances from both methods are affected by daily luck and luck buffs, among other factors. The Burglar's Ring and Monster Compendium do not impact the chance to obtain it from monsters.\[1] There is also a ≈0.6% chance to obtain an Ice Rod from a treasure chest in the Skull Cavern.\[2]

While the Ice Rod is equipped in the trinket slot, the player occasionally shoots an ice orb that briefly freezes all monsters in its path. When enemies are within 9-10 tiles of the player, an ice orb is automatically shot straight towards the nearest enemy. Ice orbs do not cause damage and pass through all environmental objects (like mining nodes or weeds).\[3]

The time between shots (*X*) ranges from 3 to 5 seconds, and the freeze duration (*Y*) ranges from 2 to 4 seconds. These times are determined to the millisecond, and all possible values are equally likely when the Ice Rod is dropped. The trinket description will round these values to the nearest tenth of a second (*i.e.*, a freeze duration of 2.367 seconds will be displayed as 2.4 seconds).\[4] Both stats can be changed if the trinket is re-forged on an Anvil.

When dropped or re-forged, the Ice Rod has a 5% chance to become "Perfect" and change its name to the "**Perfect Ice Rod**". This variant fires every 3 seconds and freezes for 4 seconds.\[4]

## Trivia

- It is technically possible, although extremely unlikely (less than a 1-in-4.2-million chance) to receive an Ice Rod with perfect stats - i.e. a 3000 millisecond delay between shots, and a freeze duration of 4000 milliseconds, without it being a "Perfect Ice Rod".
  
  - Note that because the game rounds the values to the nearest tenth of a second, it is possible for a non-perfect Ice Rod to show a 3 second delay between shots and a freeze duration of 4 seconds but not have perfect stats.
