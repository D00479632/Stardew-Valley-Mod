Island Farmhouse

Information Build cost data-sort-value="20"&gt; 20 Golden Walnuts Build materials None Size **7x5**

The **Island Farmhouse** is the player's auxiliary residence on the Ginger Island farm. It cannot be accessed until the player unlocks Island West.

The building is initially in a state of disrepair, making it unusable. It can be repaired for data-sort-value="20"&gt; 20 Golden Walnuts. Like other Golden Walnut purchases, the process occurs immediately upon payment. The repair includes the addition of a Shipping Bin outside. Neither the building nor the shipping bin can be moved.

Repairing the farmhouse allows players to ship goods and spend the night on Ginger Island without passing out. The repaired farmhouse's interior comes furnished with a kitchen and a Tropical Bed for each player. The Island Farmhouse can be further customised, like the mainland farmhouse and cabins, with furniture, wallpaper, and flooring.

The player has the option to pay another data-sort-value="5"&gt; 5 Golden Walnuts to add a mailbox and receive mail on the island. With that upgrade, undelivered mail can be retrieved from either mailbox, regardless of where the player spent the previous night.

With the farmhouse repaired and the mailbox built, the player can then pay data-sort-value="20"&gt; 20 Golden Walnuts for the parrots to build a Farm Obelisk next to the farmhouse. The obelisk allows instantaneous travel back to the mainland farm. With the Island Obelisk on the main farm, this provides instant access between the mainland and the island without having to use Willy's ferry services.
