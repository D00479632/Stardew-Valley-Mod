“ “If you're reading this, you must be in dire need of a change. The same thing happened to me, long ago. I'd lost sight of what mattered most in life... real connections with other people and nature. So I dropped everything and moved to the place I truly belong.” — Grandpa's Letter

**Grandpa** is the first character players are introduced to. He writes a letter gifting the farmhouse, which prompts the player to move to Stardew Valley.

## Grandpa's Ghost

The player can find a note on Grandpa's Shrine, at the far Northwest corner of The Farm, which states that Grandpa will return at the start of the third year (1st of Spring, Year 3) to evaluate the player's success.

## Grandpa's Evaluation

Grandpa's evaluation is directly related to the number of candles that light up around Grandpa's Shrine (there are 4 candles) at the beginning of year three. This is determined by a point system based on various milestones that were reached in the first two years. There is a total of 21 available points.

The player can be re-evaluated at any time by placing a Diamond into Grandpa's Shrine (Grandpa will show up on the following day, after a game load or the first day of the following season in some cases). This means that the opportunity to obtain all four candles is extended beyond the initial two year evaluation.
