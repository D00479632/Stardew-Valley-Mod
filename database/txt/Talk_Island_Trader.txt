Requirement to stock Galaxy Soul
Text was added to this page and the Galaxy Soul page in December that indicates a requirement for the Galaxy Soul to be added to the Island Trader stock (see below). (Curiously, the two pages were updated minutes apart by different editors, neither of whom is still actively editing.) Anyway, I find that text very confusing. This page was edited last month with additional text on the matter that I find much less confusing, but which still doesn't make clear to me what is required to get Galaxy Soul into the Island Trader stock. By one reading, it contradicts what the other edit says, so that just adds to the confusion.
The basic requirement is killing 50 monsters. Which monsters count? Which monsters do not count? When do they count?
There is an exclusion related to "Qi Challenges" with a link to Qi's Special Orders quests. I don't see any Qi quests that require me to kill monsters. There are two that require me to reach Level 100 of the Skull Cavern and one that requires me to reach the bottom of the Mines starting again from the top. Is that what it's talking about? Those can be completed with staircases, so one is not actually required to kill any monsters to complete them. Is it saying that if you do kill monsters in those areas during those quests, they don't count? Or do no monsters count while those quests are active? Or do only monsters killed during those quests count (the recent edit seems to rule out this interpretation)? Or is it something else that I'm overlooking?
Is there anyone out there who understands this more than I do, who can explain what's actually going on? Thanks. Zendowolf (talk) 07:00, 17 May 2021 (UTC)
According to Locations.IslandNorth::getIslandMerchantTradeStock, the galaxy soul will be added to the stock at the last day of each month after "hardModeMonstersKilled" > 50. According to Gamelocation::damageMonster and Monsters.Monster::BuffForAdditionalDifficulty, there are 5 C# files refer to this function. Therefore, the "hardModeMonsters" should be Dangerous Monsters which only appear in the dangerous Mines and the Skull Cavern. I will add references on this page :) Horizon98 (talk) 11:02, 17 May 2021 (UTC)
