2 Willow Lane is the home of sisters Emily and Haley. It's located along the southern road in Pelican Town, just next to 1 Willow Lane where Jodi, Kent and their sons live.

Interior
Sewing Machine
After the player acquires Cloth, exiting the Farmhouse between 6am and 11am on a day when it's not raining will trigger a cutscene in which Emily tells them about her sewing machine. Thereafter, the sewing machine can be used to tailor or dye clothing. The dye pots located to the right of the sewing machine are also unlocked.
After completing the "Rock Rejuvenation" Story Board quest, the player will receive their own Sewing Machine that functions identically to Emily's Sewing Machine.
