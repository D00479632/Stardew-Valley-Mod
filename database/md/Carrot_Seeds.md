## Tailoring

Carrot Seeds are not used in any tailoring. They can be used in dyeing, serving as an orange dye at the dye pots located in Emily's and Haley's house, 2 Willow Lane. They can also be used as a brown dye when used in the spool of the Sewing Machine with a dyeable clothing item in the feed.
