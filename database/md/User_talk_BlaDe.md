## Helpful Info

Hello BlaDe!

I saw your comments on the remixed bundles in the talk page, and based off of most of my remixed bundles runs I believe the random slots that you put in your user page are accurate. I also see the table about the fish size and quality which is exactly what I was looking for for most of the months I was here on the wiki.

I hope you don't mind if I start transcribing this info onto the main wiki. I will credit you for all of it, as I'm sure you found and verified all of this info yourself through the game code.

Hi Pi! The fish table was created by Nebulous Maestrous on the old wiki. I believe this was the result of actual fishing. I am planning on updating the main remixed bundles page today, just wanted to let it sit for a day to see how it looked before comitting it. BlaDe (talk) 19:31, 28 September 2021 (UTC)

## Remixed Bundles

Do you remember off the top of your head which bundles changed colors? I need to update Template:Bundle with the correct colors, so if you remember (or have notes), it would be much appreciated!

Thanks so much for updating the Remixed Bundles page! margotbean (talk) 15:54, 29 September 2021 (UTC)

Update: It looks like only 3 bundles changed -- Treasure Hunter's and Home Cook's went from purple to yellow, and Children's went from purple to green. If that's not accurate, please let me know, otherwise, I'll proceed with that info. Thanks again, margotbean (talk) 16:17, 29 September 2021 (UTC)

Yes, only bundles present in remixed needed to have the colour updated. BlaDe (talk) 20:11, 29 September 2021 (UTC)
