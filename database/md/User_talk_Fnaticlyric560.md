## Re: "Coat of Many Colors"

Hi! I'd be happy to help you with your project! Trouble is, I don't have much experience with the dye pots in Haley's and Emily's house, so I don't know which objects correspond to which dye pot colors! If you could send me a spreadsheet or something of the sort that lists every item that can be used to dye objects and what colors they correspond to that would be very helpful.

If you go to the Dyeing page, scroll down to the dye pots section of the page, and below the lengthy description, you will find a complete list of all items usable to dye with of each color. I have competed 3/4 of the red section so if you can do the orange section, that would be great! I have been copy and pasting the same thing for each page in the tailoring section. You can go ahead and create your own variation of what I have been using, or just change out the word 'red' for orange. Below this is what I have been using: "It can also be used as a red dye in the dye pots, located in Haley's and Emily's house, 2 Willow Lane." I usually change it a little to fit into previous text, but it seems to be working. Thanks for helping! (I have literally asked 6 different people, and you are the only one to even respond!) :D Fnaticlyric560 (talk) 01:34, 8 September 2021 (UTC)

Also, if you need another example, just look at the Tailoring section of the Magma Geode page. Fnaticlyric560 (talk) 01:38, 8 September 2021 (UTC)

## Hello

Hello, Fnaticlyric560. I am new to the wiki, and would like some advise when it comes to editing, as I have no previous wiki editing experience. Can you help me? Spaceman882 (talk) 02:05, 8 September 2021 (UTC)

Sure! I figured out what to do and what NOT to do because of User:Margotbean, an admin for the wiki. I reccomend reading the help:editing page to get started. It pretty much answers any questions you may have. Enjoy, and welcome to the wiki!Â :) Fnaticlyric560 (talk) 02:08, 8 September 2021 (UTC)

## Images

Hello Fnaticlyric! There's a place for you to show off your farms (present and future) on the official forums: https://forums.stardewvalley.net/forums/valley-showcase.15/

The wiki isn't really the place for such a personal file. I'll give you a day or so to copy it to your computer, then I'm going to have to delete it. So sorry, margotbean (talk) 21:49, 24 September 2021 (UTC)

Sorry about that! I accedentally downloaded the wrong file to the wiki (I was trying to do something else) and by the time I realised it, it was too late. After that, I lost track of the file. Whoops! Fnaticlyric560 (talk) 00:34, 25 September 2021 (UTC)

Go ahead and delete it, I already had it saved on my chromebook. The pic was a plan for what me and my siblings wanted our farm together to eventually look like. Fnaticlyric560 (talk) 00:41, 25 September 2021 (UTC)
