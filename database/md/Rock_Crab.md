**Rock Crabs** are an enemy found in the Mines. 60 rock crabs (any type) need to be killed for the Monster Eradication Goal at the Adventurer's Guild.

## Behavior

They disguise themselves as stones, sometimes surprising the player. When immobile, they are invulnerable to attack, though they can be hit with a pickaxe to knock them back, making them mobile again.

## Strategy

Rock Crabs may be differentiated from rocks by striking them with a weapon. A Rock Crab will make a knocking sound and a zero damage indicator will pop up when hit with a weapon, while a rock will not.

Hidden Rock Crabs can also be differentiated visually from rocks by a lighter shadow, as well as the presence of two brown pixels on the lower right-hand side of the rock where usually these would be black. In the image below, the Rock Crab is on the left, and a normal rock is on the right.

The Rock Crab can only be dealt damage if it is mobile, and not hiding beneath its shell. Strike an immobile Rock Crab with a pickaxe to make it mobile again.

Striking a Rock Crab with a pickaxe enough times will knock the shell off of its back, and will cause it to flee. Alternatively, setting off a bomb near a Rock Crab can remove its shell, and will cause it to flee as well.
