Speed-Gro

Stimulates leaf production. Guaranteed to increase growth rate by at least 10%. Mix into tilled soil. Information Source Pierre's • Crafting • Bone Mill Sell Price data-sort-value="20"&gt;20g Recipe Recipe Source(s) Farming Level 3 Ingredients Pine Tar (1) Moss (5) Produces 5 Speed-Gro per craft

**Speed-Gro** is a Fertilizer that speeds crop growth by 10% (or a total of 20% with the Agriculturist Profession)\[1]. It can be crafted, obtained from a Bone Mill, or purchased from Pierre's for data-sort-value="100"&gt;100g starting on Spring 15th of year 1.\[2] Twenty Speed-Gro is the reward for completing the Spring Crops Bundle in the Pantry.

Speed-Gro can be placed on tilled soil *before or after* planting a seed, or at any stage of crop growth. It does not reduce time between harvests for multi-harvest crops.

Applying Speed-Gro days after planting a seed still decreases the time it takes to fully grow, but it reduces a fixed amount of days per stage for each crop regardless of the day it's applied, and the reduction in stages that the crop has already passed will not retroactively apply. Combined with the fact that the reduction disproportionately affects earlier stages more, this means that its reduction to the rest of the growth time is much lower than the advertised percentage of 10%.\[3].
