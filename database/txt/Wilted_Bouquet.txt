The Wilted Bouquet is a special gift that you can give to any or all marriage candidates whom you are dating.
Giving a wilted bouquet immediately ends the dating relationship and reduces the friendship level with the marriage candidate to 5 hearts (1250 points). However, unlike having a divorce with a spouse, you are still able to talk and give gifts to them.
A Wilted Bouquet is created by putting a Bouquet into a furnace (requires one coal). It will be finished crafting when the clock ticks over to the next 10-minute interval.
The bouquet can be sold for 100g via the shipping box, the same sale price as a regular Bouquet. Pierre will not buy them back.
Tailoring
Wilted Bouquet is used in the spool of the Sewing Machine to create the Darkness Suit.
Trivia
Attempting to give your spouse a Wilted Bouquet will bring up a text box that says, "It wouldn't make sense to give this to <spouse name>.".
