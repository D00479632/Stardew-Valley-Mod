The Mahogany Seed is a seed that grows into a Mahogany Tree. It can be obtained by shaking or chopping down a Mahogany Tree, using an Axe or Pickaxe to dig up a Mahogany Seed dropped by a fully grown Mahogany Tree on The Farm, chopping a Large Stump or a Large Log, inside of a Golden Coconut, or killing Slimes in the Secret Woods.
Mahogany Seeds can also be purchased from the Island Trader for 1 Stingray, or from the Raccoon Wife's Shop for 20 Coal after completing four requests.
Mahogany Seeds fertilized with Tree Fertilizer have a 60% chance of growing to the next stage each night. Unfertilized seeds have a 15% chance of growing to the next stage.
