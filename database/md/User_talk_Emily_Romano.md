## Outfit

Hello Emily, please stop changing section headings and text from "portrait" to "outfit". Thank you, margotbean (talk) 17:35, 29 March 2024 (UTC)

Sorry I just saw this, I saw you change my edits and then realized I made a mistake. Please forgive me. Emily Romano (talk) 17:44, 29 March 2024 (UTC)

I had only changed it orignally because I thought it might be confusing to readers to have a furniture portrait and refer to the character images as portraits. Would you like to add in the furniture portraits of the spouses in their history? (without changing the name of anything) Emily Romano (talk) 17:46, 29 March 2024 (UTC)

it's all right, no worries. I may add the furniture items if I ever have time! (You can do it in the meantime, if you would like to.) margotbean (talk) 17:55, 29 March 2024 (UTC)

Ok, will do. I absolutely love Krobus so that's why I did him first. Though I then thought it wouldn't be fair for the other people who love the other bachelors and bachelorettes so then I started adding thier's in as well. I will get to work on it, I may not finish them all, but I will try. Emily Romano (talk) 17:59, 29 March 2024 (UTC)

Hey sorry to bother you but one more thing, there is a weird link at the very bottom of Penny's page to a reddit post. I don't see it in the editing and I don't know if it should be removed but it doesn't look like it supposed to be there. It links to this page: https://www.reddit.com/r/StardewValley/comments/4b8s7v/comment/d16zqdf Emily Romano (talk) 18:09, 29 March 2024 (UTC)

About the link at the bottom of Penny's page: near the top of the article, at the end of the Relationships section, is a sentence that references that link with the notation "1" in superscript. Cheers! Giles (talk) 18:39, 29 March 2024 (UTC)
