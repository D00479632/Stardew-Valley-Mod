This page lists the productivity of processing Fruits and Mushrooms into Artisan Goods in a Dehydrator.

The products produced usually sell for more than the raw input items, so using a Dehydrator is almost always profitable. Items that lose gold are highlighted in red, and items whose net increase in value is zero are highlighted in orange. The profit made from processing items is lowest when using iridium quality and highest when using regular quality items.

This table does not take into account the effects of Tiller or Artisan professions, which reduce and increase the profit from a Dehydrator, respectively. To view the profitability for those professions, use the links at the top of the page.
