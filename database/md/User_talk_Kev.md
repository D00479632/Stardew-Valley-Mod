## User name

Congratulations on your recent discovery of your true self! Unfortunately, I don't believe there's a way to transfer your account to a new user name. You can change your signature to read "Celeste", but your account name will still be Kev. So, your best bet is to create a new account. Best of luck! margotbean (talk) 23:45, 16 March 2021 (UTC)

Seems that Special:RenameUser isn't available here; as such... new account time! Thanks once againÂ :) Kev (talk) 23:48, 16 March 2021 (UTC)
