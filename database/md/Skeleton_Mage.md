**Skeleton Mages** are an enemy found in the Mines or after activating the Shrine of Challenge or during the Danger In The Deep quest. They can also be found in the Quarry Mine at any time. 50 Skeletons (any type) need to be killed for the Monster Eradication Goal at the Adventurer's Guild.

## Behavior

Skeleton Mages have two distinct spells that fire from a distance, a white spell that follows a straight line and deals damage to the player, and a blue spell that "trembles", similar to the Shadow Shaman long-distance spell, and causes the Frozen debuff, paralyzing the player for 2 seconds. In addition to casting spells, the Skeleton Mage approaches the player to deal collision damage.

## Strategy

The Skeleton Mage raises its hands when it is about to cast a spell; at this point dodge, then approach and attack quickly and back away when it prepares to fire again. If caught by its freezing spell, just attack to try to keep enemies away.
