**??HMTGF??** is a secret piece of furniture obtained by placing a Super Cucumber in the brown box located north of the Blacksmith's shop, inside the fenced area. A hole in the fence allowing access to the box is hidden behind a tree on the right-hand side of the enclosure. Once placed, the statue can be moved by holding left-click, or by using a tool.
