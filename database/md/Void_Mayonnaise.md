**Void Mayonnaise** is an Artisan Good made by placing a Void Egg inside the Mayonnaise Machine. It can also be obtained by fishing in the Witch's Swamp if the player does not have one in inventory and the Henchman is guarding the Witch's Hut (5% chance).

Gifting a Void Mayonnaise to the Henchman outside the Witch's Hut will allow players to pass during the quest Goblin Problem.
