**Dust Sprites (dangerous)** are an enemy found in the Mines after activating the Shrine of Challenge or during the "Danger In The Deep" quest. 500 Dust Sprites (any type) need to be killed for the Monster Eradication Goal at the Adventurer's Guild.

They count as regular Dust Sprites for Clint's Special Orders Quest.

## Behavior

Dust Sprites often travel in packs. They bounce in place and chirp while inactive. If they spot the player, dust sprites will bound after them, causing damage upon collision. Occasionally, they will break a rock that is in their way. On floors 51-69, they will become immobilized if they come in contact with a spider web.

## Strategy

Simply hit them. Cornering them against a wall will keep them from being knocked out of range with repeated swinging. Because of their bouncy behavior, it's easy for them to be closer than expected.
