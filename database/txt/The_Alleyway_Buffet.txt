The Alleyway Buffet is a power book that can be obtained by searching a golden garbage can located in the easternmost region of Pelican Town. There is a hidden opening in the eastern fence, just north of the Minecart track outside of the Blacksmith. The player must have at least a steel or better axe and pickaxe to clear a large log and boulder blocking the path. The golden garbage can is hidden behind a tree in the clearing at the end of the path.
It can also be purchased from the Bookseller for 20,000g starting in Year 3 (≈9% chance to appear).[1]
The first reading grants the player a power that increases their chance to find items in Garbage Cans by 20%.[2] Once read, it can be found in the Player's Menu on the Special Items & Powers tab. Each subsequent reading gives the player 100 Foraging XP.
