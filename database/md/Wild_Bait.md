Linus (4-heart event)

Ingredients Fiber (10) Slime (5) Bug Meat (5) Produces 5 Wild Bait per craft

**Wild Bait** is a type of bait that makes it possible to catch two fish at the same time. The chance of two fish being caught at once is equal to `0.25 + Daily Luck / 2.0`. It also reduces the delay before a nibble on a fishing rod by 62.5%, making fish bite slightly faster than with standard bait.\[1] The chance of catching 2 fish does not apply to Legendary Fish. It can however, catch 2 of the semi-Legendary fish caught from the Extended Family quest line.

Wild Bait can be crafted after being taught the recipe by Linus during his 4-heart cutscene. Once the recipe is known it is also possible to obtain Wild Bait from regular Fishing Treasure Chests and Golden Fishing Treasure Chests. It can also be found in artifact spots on Ginger Island, even before triggering the cutscene with Linus.

Note that catching two fish does not grant double fishing experience points. However, catching two fish while working on a fishing or special order quest counts both fish toward the required total.

Wild Bait cannot be used with the Training Rod or the Bamboo Pole. Only the Fiberglass Rod, the Iridium Rod, and the Advanced Iridium Rod can use bait.

Wild bait can be used in a Crab Pot, where it decreases the chance of catching trash (if the player does not have the Mariner profession) compared to using standard bait and gives a 25% chance to yield double the amount of items. This stacks with the power from The Art O' Crabbing.\[2]
