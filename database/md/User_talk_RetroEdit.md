## Page moves

Hi RetroEdit, I'm messaging to let you know that I'll be undoing the changes you made to the skills pages. The old pages are inter-language linked, and all those links are now broken. This is why Help:Editing directs users to use talk pages to propose template changes before making them; changes affect 12 languages.

Thereafter, I can look at making the changes in all 12 languuages. But for now, I'm restoring the old system. Thanks for your understanding. margotbean (talk) 20:41, 24 February 2021 (UTC)
