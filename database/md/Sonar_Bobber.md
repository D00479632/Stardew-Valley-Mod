Fish being caught is displayed on the top-right of the fishing mini-game

The **Sonar Bobber** is a tackle that helps fishing by showing what fish is on the line before it is caught. The fish being hooked is revealed right outside of the mini-game display on the top-right.

It can be crafted, purchased from Willy's Fish Shop for data-sort-value="500"&gt;500g after reaching Fishing level 6, or randomly found in regular Fishing Treasure Chests (3-4% chance) after reaching Fishing level 6 and in Golden Fishing Treasure Chests (9-10% chance).\[1]

Note that using two Sonar Bobbers on an Advanced Iridium Rod provides no additional benefit as opposed to only using one.

Only the Iridium Rod or the Advanced Iridium Rod can equip tackle. The Iridium Rod can only attach one tackle at a time, while the Advanced Iridium Rod can attach two. To attach tackle, left-click on the tackle, then right-click on the rod. To remove tackle, first right-click to remove any bait, then right-click to remove the tackle. For an Advanced Iridium Rod, the left tackle will be the first one removed.

Tackle does not stack in inventory or chests; each tackle takes up one inventory slot.
