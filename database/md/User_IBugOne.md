A random Stardew Valley player (Steam).

Details on reaction and friendship

The game runs through these checks with the precedence in this order:

- Secret result:
  
  - Include Lucky Purple Shorts

<!--THE END-->

- Best result: One of the following criteria:
  
  - Item of gold or iridium quality with a base price of at least 160
  - Item of silver quality with a base price of at least 300 and an edibility greater than 10

Friendship with all eligible villagers will be increased by 120 for that player

- Good result: One of the following criteria:
  
  - Item edibility is at least 20
  - Item base price is at least 100
  - Item base price is at least 70 and quality is silver or greater

Friendship with all eligible villagers will be increased by 60 for that player

- Neutral result: One of the following criteria:
  
  - Item base price is greater than 20 and edibility is at least 10
  - Item base price is at least 40 and edibility is at least 5

No friendship changes for the player who added this item

- Bad result:
  
  - Item edibility is at least 0

Friendship with all eligible villagers will be decreased by 50 for that player

- Worst result:
  
  - Item edibility is greater than -300 and less than 0

Friendship with all eligible villagers will be decreased by 100 for that player

With multiple players, Governor's reaction will be the mayor's shorts response if they are added, the missing item response if less items were added than the current number of players, or the worst of the added item responses. In a multiplayer game, the Governor's response does not dictate the friendship gain or loss for everyone, but instead the item added by each player will only affect that player's friendships with the villagers.

*Note: If Lucky Purple Shorts are seen, the game stops evaluating other items that have been put in the soup. This means that another player's friendship level may or may not be affected by what they themselves have put in, depending on whether that player's item is evaluated before the Lucky Purple Shorts*
