The **Mega Bomb** is a one-time use explosive item. It damages certain items within its radius. Other items are impervious to its effects.

Mega Bombs can be crafted or purchased from the Dwarf (in The Mines and in the Volcano Dungeon) for data-sort-value="1600"&gt;1,600g. They are also offered by the Desert Trader, who will trade five Iridium Ore for one Mega Bomb. They can be purchased from the Calico Egg Merchant at the Desert Festival for data-sort-value="15"&gt; 15 Calico Eggs. Squid Kids, Iridium Bats, Haunted Skulls, and Magma Duggies may also drop a Mega Bomb when slain. Mega Bombs can be won from the Crane Game inside the Movie Theater, during any season. Five Mega Bombs may occasionally be found in Treasure Rooms in the Skull Cavern. 3-5 Mega Bombs may occasionally be found in Supply Crates on the Beach Farm provided the player has upgraded the Farmhouse at least two times. A Bomb may occasionally be purchased from the Traveling Cart for data-sort-value="50"150–1,000g. Five Mega Bombs may be received from opening a Mystery Box or Golden Mystery Box. Six or eight Mega Bombs can be given as a prize from the prize machine in the Mayor's Manor. Kent may randomly send one in the mail as a gift.

Tip: Due to the wide blast area it is often a challenge to use the Mega Bomb without taking damage. Ensure ample healing supplies are available when using this. If a player has read the Dwarvish Safety Manual, they will take 25% less damage from a Mega Bomb.

## Effects

Note that the following is not an exhaustive list:

- Rocks and ore/gem nodes will drop their respective ores, gems, etc.
- Mushrooms, Artifact Spots, and foraged minerals will be destroyed.
- Any untilled dirt tiles within a significantly smaller radius will become tilled. In The Mines and Skull Cavern, any items (*e.g.,* clay, artifacts) will be dropped at the same rate as a player using a hoe; elsewhere, nothing will drop (unless the spot in question is the subject of a Secret Note).
- Crafted artisan and refining equipment will be destroyed.
- Heaters will be destroyed.
- Auto-Grabbers will *not* be destroyed, whether empty or containing items.
- Trees will be destroyed when their health reaches zero (four Mega Bombs will knock down a fully grown tree, and two more will destroy the stump). Trees will drop wood, sap, and any seeds they contained.

## Radius

The Mega Bomb has a radius of 6-8 tiles.
