## Behavior

Dust Sprites are small creatures which often travel in packs. They bounce in place and chirp while inactive. If they spot the player, dust sprites will bound after them, causing damage upon collision. Occasionally, they will break a rock that is in their way.

## Strategy

Simply hit them. Cornering them against a wall will keep them from being knocked out of range with repeated swinging or stabbing. Because of their bouncy behavior, it's easy for them to be closer than expected.

## Respawning

Traveling to the entrance to the Mines will reset all floors. Repeatedly farming frozen levels of the Mines, then exiting the mines will allow for repeated farming of Dust Sprites.
