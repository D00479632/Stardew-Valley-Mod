### Number of Harvests

Most fertilizers have limited effect on multiple-harvest crops, including Cranberries. Basic, Quality, and Deluxe fertilizers affect only the first berry from each harvest, and Speed-Gro fertilizers do not decrease the time between harvests. As shown in the comparison above, while Deluxe Speed-Gro (≈0.25%) will drop the initial growth time from 7 to 5.25 days, the amount of yields per season after that point is still 4. Retaining soil may potentially be useful to reduce watering.

## Tips

- The second day appearance can be deceiving as it looks almost identical to the dead crop sprite, without the brown color.
