The **Rabbit's Foot** is an animal product obtained from a Rabbit with sufficient friendship, mood, and daily luck.

One may be purchased from Jas in her shop at the Desert Festival for data-sort-value="100"&gt; 100 Calico Eggs. It can also be gifted by a pet cat with max friendship.

Despite the description, luck buffs do not influence the chances of getting a rabbit's foot, nor does carrying a rabbit's foot increase the player's luck.
