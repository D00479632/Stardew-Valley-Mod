## Welcome To the Wiki!

I am glad you reached out to me for guidance before editing, because you should have some sort of idea of what you are doing when it comes to editing. Once again, you should read the help:editing guide to know what you are doing. Thank you, and I feel I speak for everyone when I say this: Welcome to the Wiki!
