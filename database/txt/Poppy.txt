The Poppy is a flower that can be grown from Poppy Seeds in 7 days. Unlike all other flowers, Poppies are a universally hated gift; Penny, who loves Poppies, is the only exception.
If placed within proper range of a Bee House (5 squares in any cardinal direction), a Poppy will cause Poppy Honey to be produced, increasing the honey base value from 100g to 380g.
Poppies can be purchased from the Traveling Cart for 420–1,000g.

Tailoring
Poppy can be used in the spool of the Sewing Machine to create the dyeable Pleated Skirt. It can be used in dyeing, serving as an orange dye at the dye pots, located in Emily's and Haley's house, 2 Willow Lane.
Notes
Poppies have an equal chance of being one of three different colors. Poppies of different colors will occupy different slots in inventory or chests. Three colors × four quality levels = 12 possible spaces used.
