## Trivia

- Receiving the letter from Willy with the Lobster Bisque recipe on 14 Winter, Year 2 and watching The Queen of Sauce before checking the mail will result in the letter still in the mailbox, but the recipe box at the bottom of the letter will be blank.
- Although its description states that it is "a secret family recipe", it can be learned from The Queen of Sauce.
