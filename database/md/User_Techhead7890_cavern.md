Common list of supplies for Skull Cavern

Name Quantity  
per day Pricing \[Total] Notes Salad 20-30 \[~3000g] Need to restore 1000+ health, flexibility is great. Also up to 1 per hole. Explosive Ammo 10 150g ea in coal; (6x or 1500g coal batches) Mummies (probably not as essential) Pumpkin Soup 2-3 400g ea? Lasts 7min, increase Luck Planned items Bomb? x10? 250g (Clint Coal) or 600g (Dwarf) Harvesting for Gold/Iridium Ore as these are multi-hit rocks; will also produce geodes from rocks.  
Diameter 11, hits 75 *tiles*, 6x the size of ammo. Megabomb x?? Craftable Diameter 15, twice the zoning, no coal requirement. Usually can clear wall to wall Cherry Bomb x?? 300g ea Not actually more effective per area, but very granular. If buying direct, this is probably the most efficient use of the gold for targeting nodes, while still being double the area of explosive ammo. Diameter 7 wide. Totem 1 \[3 Omni Geodes] (save some per day to trade); save 4+ hrs in morning, rounding up to about 25% of day Staircase 3-5? 9900g (Robin) Skip bad floors. Seems that apx 10% of expected count is a good aim.

It appears that things can go a little polynomial past around 30 (where I've usually gotten on gold pick).

*Galaxy* Sword has ~70 dmg, low roll 60, +10 for Gavel, and then about 10% off Ruby too. That being said... a serpent has 150hp and if you low roll you may end up having to hit 3 times anyway. Need to verify.
