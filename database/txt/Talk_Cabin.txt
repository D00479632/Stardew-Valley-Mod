Parsnip seeds
Does this imply that you can move cabins after spawning in or potentially even later on if the cabin is destroyed and rebuilt to reissue the seeds? Techhead7890 (talk) 17:13, 13 September 2021 (UTC)
That depends on what you mean by "move cabins". If you mean move their location at the Carpenter's Shop, I believe only the host has that ability. If you mean move into another cabin after collecting parsnip seeds, you cannot. If the host destroys the cabin, that effectively removes the farmhand from the game, and another cabin has to be built. I suppose this could be exploited to spawn more parsnip seeds, if the farmhand doesn't mind leaving and re-entering the game. margotbean (talk) 16:48, 14 September 2021 (UTC)
