## Produce

*Main article: Animals#Produce*

Sheep who eat every day mature after 4 nights have passed. Once mature, a Sheep periodically grows a wool coat, which can be shorn with Shears that can be purchased at Marnie's Ranch. Shearing sheep by hand increases friendship by 5 points. Alternatively, an Auto-Grabber will automatically shear every Sheep in a Barn.

A mature sheep grows in its coat every 3 days, if it is fed and has at least 70 happiness. Having at least 4.5 Hearts (900 points) of Friendship reduces the time by one day. The Shepherd Profession also reduces the time by one day. Both together reduce the time by two days, resulting in a sheep capable of producing wool every day.

Wool can be placed in a Loom to produce Cloth, which sells for data-sort-value="470"&gt;470g. Quality Wool has a chance to produce 2 Cloth.

## Reproduction

Sheep, like cows, pigs, and goats, have a low chance to reproduce. The more animals there are inside the same barn, the higher the chance an animal will give birth. When it occurs, the player will receive a notice at the bottom of the screen before the day starts, stating "During the night, \[parent's name] gave birth to a baby sheep." Other than this, there is no indication that a sheep is pregnant.

## Selling

Sheep can be sold. The selling price is dependent on how many hearts the animal has (data-sort-value="10400"&gt;10,400g max).
