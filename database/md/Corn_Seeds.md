## Trivia

- Normal quality Corn sells for data-sort-value="50"&gt;50g, but 2 packets of Corn Seeds sell for a total of data-sort-value="150"&gt;150g. This is the same sell price as corn pickles (assuming no Artisan Profession), but instead of 4000 minutes in a Preserves Jar, it takes 20 minutes in a Seed Maker.
