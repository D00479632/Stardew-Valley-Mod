Mining (Level 2)
Ingredients
Stone (99)
The Staircase is a craftable item used to instantly create a ladder that leads down one floor in the Mines or Skull Cavern. It cannot be placed on floors 0 or 120 of the mines, in the Quarry Mine, or in the Volcano Dungeon.
Staircases work just like the game-supplied down-ladders. Each one works only for one use. Leaving the mine or returning to a higher floor will result in the staircase being permanently gone. In addition, once a staircase has been placed, it cannot be picked up again, even if it has not been used.
Stone can be purchased from Robin at the Carpenter's Shop if the player does not have enough. In year 1, the cost is 99 Stones × 20g = 1,980g per staircase. In year 2+, the cost is 99 Stones × 100g = 9,900g per staircase. The Desert Trader will trade staircases for one Jade each on Sundays. Kent sells Staircases in his shop at the Desert Festival for 30 Calico Eggs.
Tips
Staircases can be used to escape difficult enemies or descend quickly in the Mines or Skull Cavern.
Using Jade from Crystalariums for staircases at the Desert Trader on Sundays and putting them in deconstructors can net the player massive amounts of stone quickly.
Using a staircase in the Mayor's bedroom will trigger a secret event.
History
1.4: Staircases can now be stacked in inventory and chests.
1.6: Fixed bug where placing a staircase in the pants slot of the player's inventory would turn it into a secret clothing item. Added new Mayor's bedroom easter egg. Now obtainable during Desert Festival.
