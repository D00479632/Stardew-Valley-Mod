Removing Exhaustion by Kissing Spouse
Discovered by reddit user "asrk790" in this post. Confirmed in NPC.cs::checkAction. --margotbean (talk) 22:29, 1 November 2017 (UTC)
It's a really good tip. This is already outlined on the page, should we have it twice? Katzeus (talk) 10:55, 2 November 2017 (UTC)
I'm gonna say no. I removed the 2nd occurrence and messaged the editor about it. margotbean (talk) 13:51, 2 November 2017 (UTC)
Actual Values for Health/Energy
As of PC v1.2.33, for reference, in Game1::doneEating, the energy that is is added upon eating an item is
(int)Math.Ceiling((double)Edibility * 2.5) + quality * Edibility
Health added upon eating an item is
Math.Min(Game1.player.maxHealth, Game1.player.health + ((Edibility < 0) ? 0 : ((int)((float)num * 0.45f))))
The Energy value displayed on the tooltip of an edible item is found in IClickableMenu::drawHoverText.
Energy tooltip = (int)Math.Ceiling((double)Edibility * 2.5) + quality * Edibility
Health tooltip = Energy * (int)((float)healAmountToDisplay * 0.4f)

Known Behavior? (Bug?)
I recently attained Combat level 5 on the same day that I arrived at level 100 of the mines. I ate the stardrop, then continued mining a couple more hours. (I was counting on the skill level increase to power me up to max the next day.) I missed the 2AM bedtime by game seconds, but collapsed inside the farmhouse, so that should have been ok. At the day's end interactions I chose the Fighter profession, for a 15-max-health upgrade.
When I awoke, my current health was 120 instead of the new 135 max, and my stamina was 270 instead of the new 304 max. Apparently, the skill level increase did not cover recovery to my new maxes, but only to my previous maxes. Seems rather like a bug to me. Has anyone else seen this? Is it intended game behavior?

No max energy restoration when reaching level 10
Reaching level 10 in a skill doesn't appear to protect you against the energy reduction rules, if that's the only level up and you go to bed late. If you also level up another skill the same day, or go through level 9 and 10 the same day, then it seems that you will still be fully restored. Not yet sure about level 5, this will require a little bit of in-game testing, which I'm not going to do right now One More Day (talk) 06:11, 20 January 2019 (UTC)
Island Mechanic is Different
I went from around 1100g to 0g when passing out in the Volcano Dungeon (and waking up on the island farm). Is the mechanic different in some way on the island? --Zamiel (talk) 03:29, 2 January 2021 (UTC)
