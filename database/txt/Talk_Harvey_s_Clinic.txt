Energy Tonic and Muscle Remedy needing pages
Because of Energy Tonic and Muscle Remedy not having a wiki page makes me look suspicious. Because every item has a wiki page with information about it. To me, they really need a wiki page because the wiki feels a bit incomplete not having these pages. 9000 (talk) 9:17, 13 July 2022 (UTC)
Both items have pages, they just redirect to Harvey's Clinic. I think this page already contains all information anyone would like about the items. In addition, creating individual pages would break many links across all 12 wikis, as Template:Name links to "Harvey's Clinic" in all languages. margotbean (talk) 14:32, 13 July 2022 (UTC)
