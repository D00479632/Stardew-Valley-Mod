From Stardew Valley Wiki

I want to investigate things that were in the 1.6 preview spoilers and like horseradish juice, and if they're real add them to the wiki. When I have the energy. Look I will re install and set up stardew and smapi and strardrop tonight but I am too beat for all the things.

I have a few ideas for mods too. Once again my problem is energy. blah.
