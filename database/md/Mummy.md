## Behavior

Instead of disappearing upon death like most enemy, they will collapse into a pile of bandages on the floor and will then get back up and essentially revive back to full HP after 10 seconds of being downed unless killed by a bomb whilst downed. They will tremble slightly right before getting back up. Downed Mummies are temporarily immobilized and cannot be walked through, but do not deal contact damage. In this form, they are immune to all types of damage except for explosions, which will deal 999 fixed damage.

## Strategy

Simply hit them until they fall into a pile of bandages, then use a bomb to kill them, with Cherry Bombs being particularly effective at dealing lone Mummies due to how cheap they are. Other explosive items work as well, such as Explosive Ammo. To maximize efficiency, try to lure multiple Mummies into one area, preferably one with dense clusters of rocks, and bomb them all at once.

Alternatively, players can avoid having to use any explosives to kill Mummies if they enchant a weapon with the Crusader enhancement.

Wearing a Napalm Ring will *not* automatically kill Mummies after knocking them down, and the explosions triggered by killing nearby Serpents and Carbon Ghosts are too small to be reliable, so manual bombing is usually required.

An Ice Rod is a useful trinket to prevent Mummies that have fallen into a pile of bandages from recovering, as they will remain in a pile of bandages as long as they remain frozen.

## Location

Mummies spawn in rooms resembling an Egyptian tomb, which appear randomly throughout the caverns.
