Crystalarium Insert a gem of your choice and it will grow copies. Information Source Crafting • Museum donation • 25,000 Bundle Sell Price *Cannot be sold* Crafting Recipe Source Mining (Level 9) Ingredients Stone (99) Gold Bar (5) Iridium Bar (2) Battery Pack (1)

The **Crystalarium** is a crafted item that will replicate any inserted Gem (except Prismatic Shard), Foraged Mineral, or Geode Mineral. The functions of the Crystalarium are explained in the Lost Book *Technology Report!*.

One Crystalarium is the reward for donating 50 Minerals to the Museum. One Crystalarium is also the reward for completing the 25,000 Bundle in the Vault. Occasionally it can be found in a treasure room in the Skull Cavern.

Once an item is inserted, it will replicate that item an infinite number of times. Once a gem or mineral has been inserted into the Crystalarium, it can be retrieved at any time by removing the Crystalarium with a tool.

## Use

Note that times to craft are approximate, since time passes differently from 2am to 6am. One hour = 60 minutes from 6am to 2am, but 1 hour = 100 minutes from 2am to 6am. One full day is 1600 minutes, where day is 1200 minutes and night is 400 minutes.

## Tips

- The most profitable gem to replicate is the Diamond, yielding a profit of data-sort-value="150"&gt;150g per day if harvested as soon as it is ready (five days). At this rate, the base monetary value of the materials used in crafting the Crystalarium can be recovered in about 32 days (not including a Diamond used to seed it, nor any increase in the value of the crafting materials due to profession bonuses).
  
  - Diamonds can also be traded in with the Desert Trader for the triple shot espresso.
  - Diamonds are also either liked or loved by all villagers, making the replication of Diamonds useful for gift-giving purposes.
- Earth Crystals can be replicated in about 13 in-game hours, providing two nearly universally liked gifts each day. This is more efficient than replicating Diamonds and either gifting them or selling them for Salad, which is the cheapest universally liked item that can be purchased.
- Only 7 in-game hours is required to replicate Quartz, the shortest time span for any mineral. While the Crystalarium is thus an efficient source of Quartz for making Refined Quartz, Quartz is found abundantly during mining and making Refined Quartz still requires Coal for smelting. Refined Quartz can also be produced directly in a Recycling Machine from Broken Glasses and Broken CDs, without needing coal.
  
  - Five Quartz can be traded at the Desert Trader for 1 Bomb, making the replication of Quartz in Crystalariums a more cost-effective method of obtaining Bombs than purchasing them from the Dwarf's shop for data-sort-value="1000"&gt;1,000g each.
- The Crystalarium can replicate Jade for trading with the Desert Trader for Staircases on Sundays. The staircases can then either be used in the Skull Caverns or inserted into a Deconstructor to produce 99 stone. This can save countless hours gathering stone.
- The Crystalarium can replicate Rubies for trading with the Desert Trader for Spicy Eels. The Spicy Eels can then be eaten to increase luck and player speed. This can also save time from cooking them with eels and hot peppers.
- Replicating Fire Quartz may be worthwhile; it takes only about 22 hours. It is required in the crafting recipe of a Dehydrator. One Fire Quartz and one Coal also produce three Refined Quartz when placed in a furnace, a greater efficiency than refining Quartz.
