Autumn's Bounty is a cooked dish. It is prepared using either the kitchen inside an upgraded farmhouse or a Cookout Kit. Five Autumn's Bounties are the reward for completing the Exotic Foraging Bundle in the Crafts Room.
Autumn's Bounty may randomly appear in Krobus' shop on Saturdays, in the Garbage Can outside the saloon, or in The Stardrop Saloon's rotating stock. Five Autumn's Bounties may occasionally be found in a treasure room in the Skull Cavern. One Autumn's Bounty may be received from opening a Mystery Box.
