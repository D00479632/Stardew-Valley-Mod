The Mossy Seed is a tree seed that grows into one of the three Green Rain Tree variations. Mossy Seeds can be obtained by shaking (5% chance) or chopping (5% chance) down any of the Green Rain Tree variations, including trees which temporarily become one of those variations during Fall & Winter or the Green Rain event.[1] They can also be obtained by breaking Large Weeds during the Green Rain event (5% chance).[2]
A Mossy Seed has approximately a 20% chance to grow to the next stage each night during Spring, Summer, or Fall. There are 5 stages of growth in total. The median time to maturity is about 18 days, with over 90% of seeds maturing in less than 32 growing days.
The use of Tree Fertilizer guarantees growth by one stage each night, including during Winter.
For best results obtaining Moss, plant mossy seeds near one or more other wild trees.
