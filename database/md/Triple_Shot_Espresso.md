**Triple Shot Espresso** is a cooked drink. It is prepared using either the kitchen inside an upgraded farmhouse or a Cookout Kit. Before it can be cooked, the recipe must be purchased from Gus while he's working the bar at the saloon for data-sort-value="5000"&gt;5,000g.

Triple Shot Espresso can also be purchased at the Desert Trader in exchange for a Diamond, sometimes at the Stardew Valley Fair for data-sort-value="400"&gt;400, at the Feast of the Winter Star for data-sort-value="2500"&gt;2,500g, or at the Traveling Cart for data-sort-value="450"1,350–2,250g. 1-2 Triple Shot Espresso may occasionally be found in Supply Crates on the Beach Farm if the player upgraded the Farmhouse at least once. Three Triple Shot Espresso is the reward for donating 70 items to the Museum. Wearing a Hot Java Ring gives a 7.5% chance for monsters to drop Triple Shot Espresso when killed. Two Triple Shot Espresso is one of the prizes for the Trout Derby festival. Three Triple Shot Espresso is a guaranteed gold tier reward on the 13th for the SquidFest festival. Three Triple Shot Espresso may be received from opening a Mystery Box or Golden Mystery Box. Five Triple Shot Espresso can be obtained as a prize from the Prize Machine. It is a reward for submitting an Egg Rating of 10-54 to Gil during the Desert Festival.

When consumed, it grants the player +1 Speed for 4m 12s. The speed of the player's horse is also increased. As a drink, its buff stacks with any food buffs (including Speed), but replaces any other drink buffs (*i.e.,* from Coffee, Ginger Ale or Green Tea).
