**Duggies (dangerous)** is an enemy found in the Mines after activating the Shrine of Challenge or during the Danger In The Deep quest. 30 Duggies (any type) need to be killed for the Monster Eradication Goal at the Adventurer's Guild.

## Behavior

They behave identically to their counterparts the Duggy or the Magma Duggy. They can be found within dirt patches in the cave floor, attempting to pop up and attack the player. Duggies can move and sense the player for up to two tiles.

## Strategy

Attack the Duggy once when it appears from behind, then keep moving. This prevents it from appearing directly under you and dealing unavoidable damage. Standing on the edge of a dirt patch and quickly stepping into the dirt and back to bait a Duggy out is another good strategy to kill them. Damage can be negated by blocking with a sword.
